<p>Me nervously taking my first picture as I head to training! I remember feeling nervous, and had a small panic attack looking at the wing, wondering if the turbulence could make the wing snap clean off... Obviously it didn't, but it was a nerve racking experience.</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="/_resources/52fcbe607d9845b0a2b5bd597fa4ce8b.jpg" width="956" height="714" class="jop-noMdConv" />
<p>For a while, I even wondered if I was cut out for the job. How can a flight attendant be afraid of the skies? Thankfully that was the only time I felt that sense of panic in my career. Flights became, dare I say it, boring.</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="/_resources/089f5093cbe4440caf32e5e7da378276.jpg" width="959" height="719" class="jop-noMdConv" />
<p>This was the first time really meeting everyone and getting to know their names. I was nervous but tried not to show it. There weren't that many guys there, but I've always felt more comfortable around women anyway.</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="/_resources/cbb5940753e442ee9f026fc94bb417fc.jpg" width="956" height="717" class="jop-noMdConv" />
<p>The first day of training we explore the CR Smith museum and took in the wonder of flight.</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="/_resources/bb098c552cb24a959d619d3eb3a9b95b.jpg" width="955" height="717" class="jop-noMdConv" />
<p>Not long after getting to know each other, we decided to go out clubbing as a group, and we had a blast. Here are all the women in my class, slaying as always.</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="/_resources/8220682b44fe4a13bbdfe77568dbb8bd.jpg" width="954" height="716" class="jop-noMdConv" />
<p>And here are all the men, looking fly!</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="/_resources/4cd587fc7c9d44e1bc4291aab805909a.jpg" width="955" height="717" class="jop-noMdConv" />
<p>One of the cool things about training was going on training flights with my classmates.</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="/_resources/b9efde1c35c8415186ce126083b13cb2.jpg" width="957" height="538" class="jop-noMdConv" />
<p>We also spent a lot of time in the simulator.</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="/_resources/aeeb817f86f44b9684d90f5c25c09d37.jpg" width="967" height="726" class="jop-noMdConv" />
<p>When we weren't training, we had fun playing vollyball at the training center. We actually stayed at a hotel so we didn't have as much access to the training facilities.</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="/_resources/dd8f05a617f6472b835d7cfd4b15be4f.jpg" width="968" height="726" class="jop-noMdConv" />
<p>It was still a lot of fun!</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="/_resources/fa5c04dde2194fdab4fc8f9cf58d564d.jpg" width="973" height="730" class="jop-noMdConv" />
<p>One of the highlights of training was visiting the enormous plan hangar to check the the new 777-max.</p>

<p>Because I couldn't stand to not doing something on the weekends, I would rent a car and take the other FAs out dancing.</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="/_resources/84e81dcac9ad4f5da8501ce911863ba8.jpg" width="975" height="732" class="jop-noMdConv" />
<p>Part of my exploration of Dallas when I had the rental was finding a Puerto Rican restaurant called Adobo that was amazing. I took some of my friends there to enjoy the vibe and give them a taste of Puerto Rico.</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="/_resources/39d3df6e2e454a849f83f2b02020649b.jpg" width="978" height="1304" class="jop-noMdConv" />
<p>About halfway through training were were fitted for our uniforms and got a chance to try them on, it was a lot of fun!</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="/_resources/f185c4a247ad4e16a16516c2ea824e9d.jpg" width="980" height="1740" class="jop-noMdConv" />
<p>Because training fell on my birthday, the class celebrated with me! That same day I met a flight attendant that would change my life for the better.</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="/_resources/086b93851614427e8542dd32cc902a03.jpg" width="981" height="1308" class="jop-noMdConv" />
<p>That flight attendants name was Tara. I didn't know it at the time, but she would be a big part of my life only a month after training was finished.</p>
<p>Because we spent so much time studying, actually going on a flight was one of the most exiting things we could do. The flights were turns, a flight there and then fly back.</p>

<p>These FA's were some of the kindest I've met, and were happy to show us newbies the ropes.</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="/_resources/e844f0609e28438385a66fbfe10e9b47.jpg" width="1005" height="1340" class="jop-noMdConv" />

<p>Because you never know what will happen, we all simulated putting out a fire! It was an amazing experience!</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="/_resources/6136ad064aab449083d64118b87bc8d1.jpg" width="1003" height="564" class="jop-noMdConv" />
<p>Part of the training is making sure you know how to swim! We also simulated different situations and had processes to follow to complete an objective.</p>

<p>One of the most entertaining and educational classes was the wine tasting / sommelier training. Genea and I ensured there was no port left to drink at the end!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/_resources/d3c84790bd6745a294603382e7d9f819.jpg" width="995" height="747" class="jop-noMdConv" /> <img loading="lazy" src="/_resources/12ae163423db4bad8d60ce9680ddc6ee.jpg" width="1006" height="755" class="jop-noMdConv" /></p>
<p>Near the end of training, we needed to rank the bases in order of preference. My top two choices were DFW and MIA, in that order, but I always wondered what would have happened if I had put MIA first. I don't doubt I would still be there partying it up 😂.</p>

<p>Under a 777 engine!</p>

<p>Honestly, I grew so much as a person during training. It was tough, some even called it Barbie Boot Camp! But it taught me so much about about customer service that I still use to this day.</p>
