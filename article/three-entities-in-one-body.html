          <h3 id="the-core-idea-three-entities-in-one-body">The Core Idea: Three Entities in One Body</h3>
<p>Listening to "The Power of Now" and "Philosophize This" podcasts made me realize that humans are basically a mix of three entities: the mind, the emotions, and the "watcher" or core self. The idea is to align these three so your emotional and mental states don't run the show.</p>
<h3 id="the-watcher-your-core-being">The Watcher: Your Core Being</h3>
<p>To get control back, you have to become the 'watcher' of your emotions. This involves observing your feelings without judgment. Just being aware and 'watching' your emotions can help dissipate their intensity, letting the watcher take charge. The watcher is essentially your core self, and its default state is a mix of love and joy.</p>
<h3 id="mind-vs-gut-tools-not-leaders">Mind vs. Gut: Tools, not Leaders</h3>
<p>Your mind and gut feelings are not the essence of who you are; they are tools. Your gut is more aligned with your true self than your mind. But if you let your mind or emotions lead, you'll end up in chaos. This is even more true in the age of social media distractions.</p>
<h3 id="the-danger-of-avoiding-pain">The Danger of Avoiding Pain</h3>
<p>Often, we use our minds to create distractions that shield us from confronting our true feelings, especially painful ones. We mask pain with other emotions like anger. This is a form of self-protection, but it also prevents us from facing our actual feelings, like the pain of loneliness.</p>
<h3 id="embrace-the-pain-live-in-the-now">Embrace the Pain: Live in the Now</h3>
<p>"The Power of Now" suggests diving into your pain instead of avoiding it. By being still and observing your pain, you allow your mind to acknowledge it, which in turn allows your body to let it go. This is the essence of 'living in the now.'</p>
<h3 id="the-benefits-clarity-and-control">The Benefits: Clarity and Control</h3>
<p>By diving into the pain, you can then interact with others from a place of calm power. You're honest about your feelings, which avoids projecting your pain and anger onto others. This focus keeps you in control, leading to inner peace.</p>
<h3 id="the-circle-of-control">The Circle of Control</h3>
<p>The key to maintaining this peace is to focus only on what you can control. When you start worrying about things outside your control, anxiety creeps in. So, always consider whether something is within your 'circle of control' before reacting to it.</p>
