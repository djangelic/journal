          <h3 id="the-core-idea-three-entities-in-one-body">The Core Idea: Three Entities in One Body</h3>
<p>Listening to "The Power of Now" and "Philosophize This" podcasts about Gille De Luze and Byung Chul made me come to the realization that humans are basically a mix of three entities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your Mind:</strong> Represented by your brain. It is a tool to help you navigate the world.</li>
<li><strong>Your Emotions:</strong> Represented by your gut and intestines. It is a tool to help you feel the world.</li>
<li><strong>Your Core Self:</strong> Represented by your heart. The "watcher." is the silent part of yourself that you feel when you experience love or joy.</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea is to align these three so your tools don't run your life. This goes against the current social discourse that we are individuals, a single indivisible unit. I believe that idea of individualism has lead to a lot of pain.</p>
<p>I believe that this simple mental shift can unlock better mental health, because it helps you look at the world through a perspective that is a bit closer to truth. That your identity cannot be boiled down to a single thing. I don't mean this only in a spiritual way. I mean this is a physical and biological way as well. I believe that when you make this shift, you begin to have more love and empathy for others, because you have more love and empathy for yourself.</p>
<p>This is because you realize that even the things you do alone on the daily, are a harmony of 3 different entities. When you as a human learn to juggle your 3 entities kindly, you are then able to handle the entities of others with kindness, because you recognize the struggle that we are all going through.</p>

<p><em>I generated this picture using ChatGPT and the following prompt: Vector representation of emotional self-awareness inside a luminous human figure. Within this figure: 1. A human gut stands as the wellspring of Feelings/Emotions. 2. A brain, illustrating the Mind and its capacity to sift through emotions. 3. A heart, the emblem of compassion, linked to the Gut and Brain. Soft lines or a subtle glow tie these elements, signifying the ceaseless flow of emotional and cognitive processes. The backdrop is adorned with a tranquil, soft-colored abstract design, alluding to a harmonized emotional state.</em></p>
<p>I love this picture and I think it highlights what the core governance of a human really is. A human is not a single unit, we are many different entities battling for control within the body, but governed by 3 different parts of our body. I use the heart to represent our core self, but biologically, I think it's closer to being a part of the gut since many emotions are secreted from the gut as chemicals. I think the heart makes a better representation because not only does it represent the part of our body that connects the mind and the gut, but it's also a symbol of love, which is also what I think the core of humanity is.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-this-affect-my-day-to-day-life">How does this affect my day to day life?</h3>
<p>Think of times when you've done something for pure logic, like take on a job you didn't enjoy. You were so distracted by your mind's projection of the future, that you didn't listen to your bodies needs now, like for food, or for sleep.</p>
<p>Or if you've ever slept with someone because you were lonely, you were so distracted by your bodies hormones, filling you with loneliness, that you may ignore your mind telling you it's a bad idea.</p>
<p>Or when you over eat, because you are not paying attention to the food you eat, because you are so distracted by your mind's need to get more knowledge, so you scroll social media while eating.</p>
<p>Or you are so religious that you push others away from you because your mind has painted a future vision of heaven that does not include them. Your body and mind begin to lose sync the more you continue to ignore one or the other.</p>
<p>Or you are so fit, that you don't have time to hang out with your friends, because the feeling that working out at the gym generates in your body overrides your mind's need to socialize.</p>
<p>I believe this because I believe that truth is not reality, but a feeling. It's the feeling we get when we know something is right. But because it's a feeling, it's subjective and generated as a chemical in your gut. Which means anytime someone tells you that truth can be found outside of ourselves, you can be confident that they are lying to you.</p>
<p>You cannot experience the feeling of truth someone else has experienced, but you can experience your own version of their truth. The problem usually comes from the fact that as humans, make the mistake of trying to find the "truth" about things that are outside of us, like the truths others find in religion, addiction, gender, sexuality and politics. We do this instead of acknowledging that everyone's version of truth is a little different, but that doesn't mean that there is one specific generic truth out there that fits all buckets.</p>
<p>I believe that finding real human truths are impossible to do in these realms, because our senses do not give us the ability to view reality through all the spectrums that exist, only the ones we can feel.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-the-consequences-of-confusing-truth-with-identity">What are the consequences of confusing truth with identity?</h3>
<p>When you look at yourself as 3 entities, you can begin to focus inwardly, at your own truth, and are less likely to get distracted with labels, things, and the truth that others tout as a global truths. Because other people's truth's are distracting, we sometimes confuse their truths with our identity, because we are trained to consider ourselves an individual, a single thing, so it's easy for us to boil ourselves down to that single instance of truth when it's all that we see.</p>
<p>We then ignore other truths like:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am hungry</li>
<li>I am lonely</li>
<li>I am scared</li>
<li>I am happy</li>
<li>I am loved</li>
<li>I am present</li>
</ul>
<p>And because truth is not reality, the moment that a truth we hold dearly fails us or is shown to not be true, it creates a great pain in our mind and body. Our mind, unable to deal with the pain of knowing it was wrong, creates distractions like anger or rage to hide the pain. Or your body does it through addiction to something, from drugs to food to sex.</p>
<p>If you do not allow yourself to be distracted by these things, you are able to find real truth, the truth about yourself. And if you are capable of kindness, you will begin to do your best to first of all be kind to your 3 entities, and secondly be kind to those entities in others.</p>
<h3 id="what-happens-to-those-that-get-lost-in-their-labels-or-truths">What happens to those that get lost in their labels or truths?</h3>
<p>You lose control of yourself and place it in the hands of others to define your truths. This happens not just to conservatives with religion, but with liberals with regard to gender identity and sexuality. When you let any single part of your life take over the entirety of it, you have lost control of your identity to one of your 2 tool entities, and the watcher and the other one watches helplessly as one entity controls the body like a puppet on a string.</p>
<p>Look at religious extremists. They are convinced about their truth more than anyone else, enough to die for their truths. On the other side of the spectrum, think extreme body modification. Or so wrapped up in in their gender or sexuality that they let their entire life become wrapped up in a caricature of what they think is acceptable in their community.</p>
<p>It is not our place to judge others for making these decisions, but if you are forced to judge, have empathy. Know that they have become so wrapped up in a distraction, that the distraction has become the identity, usually at some cost for the 3 entities inside the person. Maybe a distancing of the family, or a loss of their childhood community, or an addiction to drugs that has spiraled out of control.</p>
<h3 id="the-watcher-your-core-being">The Watcher: Your Core Being</h3>
<p>To get control back, you have to change your perspective from an Individual, to a 'watcher' of your emotions. This involves observing your feelings without judgment. Just being aware and 'watching' your emotions can help dissipate their intensity, letting the watcher take charge. The watcher is essentially your core self, and its default state is a mix of love and joy.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-i-exercise-the-watchers-muscles-of-control">How can I exercise the Watcher's muscles of control?</h3>
<p>Meditating or sitting and writing about your feelings can help make it easier for you to watch your emotions, since it forces you to be silent, and put on paper your feelings generated by your normally quiet gut's feelings. This forces your mind, through paper, to acknowledge what your body is feeling. When you write, write about your pain, and where it comes from. And write about what you are grateful for to help temper the negative feelings that may initially spill out.</p>
<p>Your mind on the daily is quick to hide those feelings behind your ego, so your mind twists those feelings into other related feelings to protect you from having to feel the pain of the source of your feelings and then you begin to confuse these new feelings as the source of truth, instead of the pain those things have caused. Over time you forget the source of pain and only remember the sources of anger, which further makes you identify with these feelings of anger and truth.</p>
<p>By writing, you are helping your mind and body look past the shields (distorted feelings of pain like anger and jealousy) that your mind puts up to protect your core from pain. Once you do, you can then approach others with honesty about how you feel, because you are not distracted by the superficial layer of feelings that your mind creates to protect you. Instead you can get to the root of your problems with another person, because you are not addressing the symptoms, but instead the greater root of the problem.</p>
<h3 id="does-this-mean-that-because-the-watcher-is-a-being-of-love-i-should-allow-others-to-walk-on-me">Does this mean that because the Watcher is a being of love, I should allow others to walk on me?</h3>
<p>In short, no. When you shift your perspective, you have love for your self, which is 3 entities, which means you need even more love for yourself than you did before. That means that when you are interacting with others, you have to be particularly kind to yourself, because you will not anger 1 person, you will anger at least 2 entities.</p>
<p>For example, when you are interacting with your spouse, and they something hurtful, as an individual we want to lash back. We are in the arena, 1v1. It's easy to shift into a selfish mind, when you see yourself as one.</p>
<p>But when you see yourself as 3, and her as 3, you begin to see when the other person is in pain, because they will be distracted by one or the other. Maybe they are passionate about business, so they inflict pain in you because they are distracted by the mind, painting a future where they are rich and successful. If they inflict the pain of neglect, they may turn narcissistic, their mind is distracted by their body or project, and you will see them constantly posting online for validation in themselves, or their projects.</p>
<p>This is where social media is dangerous. A distraction from our feelings, lies just a post away. And every like you get is further reinforcement of your truth, which further reinforces it as a part of your identity, and pulls you further away from your loved ones.</p>
<h3 id="if-they-are-in-just-as-much-pain-as-i-am-then-shouldnt-i-put-up-with-any-distraction-they-have">If they are in just as much pain as I am, then shouldn't I put up with any distraction they have?</h3>
<p>You can now approach from a place of truth. A shared place of pain. Their projections of pain is hiding a deeper truth, which you can now communicate to them by showing them your pain, without the distortions of anger to distract from the conversation.</p>
<p>If they refuse to come to the table with their pain, and only come with their anger, then they are not dealing with you in love. They are trying to be right, to get another hit of that Truth chemical their gut pumps out when you acquiesce to their anger, and then use it as ammo in the future.</p>
<p>If they continue to inflict pain, your new perspective lets you weigh your reality from a source of more truth about yourself. This person is not hurting you as an individual. They are hurting your mind, by generating drama to fill the hole that their pain leaves. They are hurting your body, by distracting your mind from self care rituals because of their pain.</p>
<p>You can keep choosing to bear their pain, but the only way you will be able to do so, is by distracting yourself from your pain, with addiction, or sex, or video games, or whatever it is that can distract you just enough to drown out their pain. If you however choose to observe your own pain, you will not be able to help but remove yourself from their presence because you can no longer bear the pain of observing all the pain they are causing in your multiple entities. The pain they are causing you.</p>
<p>You can look on with compassion, not only for yourself, but for the people you love around you that hurt you, because you can see their distractions more clearly. You can see the sources of their pain more easily, and you can understand that it is not in your circle of control to change. You can make the harder decisions more easily, because you are not making that decision alone, as a single individual, but as a quorum of 3 entities who need relief from the pain.</p>
<h3 id="embrace-the-pain-live-in-the-now">Embrace the Pain: Live in the Now</h3>
<p>"The Power of Now" suggests diving into your pain instead of avoiding it. By being still and observing your pain, you allow your mind to acknowledge it, which in turn allows your body to let it go. This is the essence of 'living in the now.'</p>
<p>By diving into the pain, you can then interact with others from a place of calm power. You're honest about your feelings, which avoids projecting your pain and anger onto others. This focus keeps you in control, leading to inner peace.</p>
<h3 id="the-circle-of-control">The Circle of Control</h3>
<p>The key to maintaining this peace is to focus on the only possible truth: only the things you can control. When you start worrying about things outside your control, anxiety creeps in as a way for your mind to warn you that you are stepping outside the path of being present. You are now dealing with either the past or the future, which puts the present on shaky ground because you're no longer paying attention to it.</p>
<p>So, always consider whether something is within your 'circle of control' before reacting to it. If it's not, then reacting to it is beyond useless, it's painful. If it is, focus on what you can do now to change the pain it is causing you. Whether that means leaving a toxic relationship, or letting go of the toxic thoughts that cloud your relationship, not just with others, but with yourself.</p>
