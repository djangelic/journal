It was a productive sync, but I wished we had more than just two hours. There‚Äôs so much we could have aligned on. I also might have stirred up a little tension when I suggested implementing a project management tool‚Äîdefinitely got some mixed reactions.</p><h2 id=\"go-karting-mayhem\">Go-Karting Mayhem</h2>\n<p>Then came the highlight of the day: <strong>go-karting.</strong> It was an absolute blast‚Äîpart Formula One, part endurance test.

            "content_html": "<h3 id=\"the-nest-trust-and-the-illusion-of-a-cage\"><strong>The Nest, Trust, and the Illusion of a Cage</strong></h3>\n<p>A nest is built carefully, twig by twig, with patience and intention. It is not merely a shelter‚Äîit is <strong>a home</strong>, a foundation built to protect, sustain, and nurture those within it. The nest is not a cage; it does not confine, but rather, it provides <strong>a place of belonging</strong>. It offers both security and freedom‚Äî<strong>a safe place to return to, a sanctuary that allows growth</strong>.</p><p>Birds leave the nest, but not to abandon it. They leave to gather, to experience the world, to strengthen themselves‚Äîbut always with the knowledge that what they bring back will sustain and reinforce the home they share. A bird might return with food to nourish its partner, or with twigs and soft down to make the nest even stronger. <strong>Each time they venture out, they contribute to what they are building together.</strong></p><p>In a relationship, leaving the nest should mean personal growth, exploration, and independence‚Äîbut never betrayal. True partnership is not about restriction; it is about trust‚Äîthe trust that each partner, when stepping away, does so with the intent to return with something of value. Whether that is <strong>wisdom, experience, support, or simply the reassurance of loyalty</strong>, the time spent outside the nest should enrich it, not weaken it.</p><p>But when one partner starts building <strong>multiple nests</strong>, dividing their energy and effort, something shifts. The twigs that should have reinforced the shared nest are instead placed elsewhere. The resources meant to sustain are spent outside, leaving what was once strong now fragile. <strong>A bird cannot nurture multiple nests with the same devotion. The more it divides itself, the weaker each nest becomes.</strong></p><p>At first, the original nest may hold, sustained by the effort of the one who remains, but eventually, the imbalance becomes clear. The nest that once provided warmth and safety now struggles to remain whole. And if one partner gives too much outside the nest without replenishing what they have built together, the nest does not just weaken‚Äîit begins to fall apart.</p><p>Even worse, bringing <strong>predators</strong> into the nest‚Äîothers who threaten the safety and integrity of what‚Äôs been built‚Äîdestroys it from within. A nest thrives when it is protected, when both partners are selective about what influences they allow inside. When one bird repeatedly brings threats‚Äîwhether through dishonesty, betrayal, or disregard for the shared commitment‚Äîthe nest isn‚Äôt strengthened. <strong>It becomes exposed, vulnerable to being torn apart, either by outside forces or by the first storm life throws at it.</strong></p><p>Radical acceptance teaches us that we cannot control the choices of another bird. We cannot force someone to tend to the nest if they don‚Äôt see its value. What we <em>can</em> do is acknowledge reality as it is, without judgment or resistance. We can accept the pain of watching twigs be plucked away, without letting that pain define our worth or our future. Acceptance is not giving up‚Äîit is choosing to respond to reality with wisdom instead of resistance.</p><hr>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://djangelic.com/media/posts/2/IMG_6707.jpeg\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"1290\" height=\"1229\" sizes=\"(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)\" srcset=\"https://djangelic.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_6707-xs.jpeg 320w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_6707-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_6707-md.jpeg 768w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_6707-xl.jpeg 1024w\"></figure><h3 id=\"trust-the-invisible-threads-holding-the-nest-together\"><strong>Trust: The Invisible Threads Holding the Nest Together</strong></h3>\n<p>Trust is the glue that holds the nest in place. It is not just about <strong>being faithful</strong>; it is about being <strong>honest, consistent, and dependable</strong>. Trust is what makes the nest feel like home. Without trust, the nest becomes fragile‚Äîno matter how well it was built, it begins to crumble, and eventually, it collapses.</p><p>Every time you tell the truth, every time you are accountable, every time you are kind and loving, <strong>you add a single twig to the nest.</strong> Over time, these twigs reinforce one another, creating something strong, stable, and lasting.</p><p>But every time you lie, betray, keep secrets, or hurt the other bird <strong>you don‚Äôt just remove a twig‚Äîyou risk ripping out an entire section of the nest if it‚Äôs discovered.</strong> The damage isn‚Äôt minor; it‚Äôs catastrophic. A single dishonest moment can undo months, even years, of careful building. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important to think before breaking trust‚Äîbecause rebuilding requires so much more effort than preserving what‚Äôs already there.</p><p>A nest isn‚Äôt just about love‚Äîit‚Äôs about <strong>consistent, thoughtful effort</strong>. Without trust, love alone is not enough to hold it together.</p><p>Radical acceptance reminds us that trust cannot be forced, only earned. We cannot demand that another bird handle the nest with care. What we <em>can</em> do is tend to our own integrity, ensure that our own twigs are placed with honesty and care, and accept when another bird is unwilling to do the same. And if that is the case, we must have the courage to stop waiting for them to return.</p><hr>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://djangelic.com/media/posts/2/IMG_6708.jpeg\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"1290\" height=\"1251\" sizes=\"(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)\" srcset=\"https://djangelic.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_6708-xs.jpeg 320w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_6708-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_6708-md.jpeg 768w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_6708-xl.jpeg 1024w\"></figure><h3 id=\"the-illusion-of-a-cage\"><strong>The Illusion of a Cage</strong></h3>\n<p>Some birds look at the bottom of the nest and mistake its structure for a cage. They focus only on the boundaries‚Äîthe twigs that form the edges‚Äîand feel trapped. They forget that those twigs <strong>aren‚Äôt walls keeping them in; they‚Äôre walls keeping the nest intact</strong>.</p><p>A cage is about control. A nest is about protection.</p><p>A cage is built to confine. A nest is built to nurture.</p><p>A cage forces you to stay. A nest is something you <em>choose</em> to return to.</p><p>The only time a nest becomes a cage is when someone tries to leave but still expects it to be there for them, unchanged, untouched, and waiting‚Äîwhile they build other nests elsewhere. When a bird refuses to participate in maintaining the nest but still wants to return to its warmth, <strong>it no longer sees it as a home; it sees it as an obligation or a resource.</strong></p><p>A true partnership requires <strong>choosing the nest, not just using it when convenient</strong>. It requires recognizing that boundaries <strong>aren‚Äôt restrictions</strong>; they‚Äôre reinforcements. And the moment one partner stops respecting the nest‚Äîwhether by neglect, dishonesty, or bringing outside threats into it, or hurting the other bird‚Äîthe nest is no longer a safe place.</p><p>And when only one bird is fully invested in maintaining the nest, it creates an unfair burden. The bird that is still trying, still tending to the nest, feels abandoned. They are left carrying all the responsibility, waiting for a partner who only returns when it suits them. </p><p>Worse yet, the bird that once worked so hard to maintain the nest may stop, either allowing it to crumble or, in frustration, tearing out sections of the nest themselves. Resentment changes a bird‚Äîit turns effort into exhaustion, love into obligation, and warmth into distance. <strong>It‚Äôs not about one bird being right and the other being wrong‚Äîit‚Äôs about both birds giving equal effort and understanding what the effort means so that the nest remains a place of trust, not resentment.</strong></p><hr>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://djangelic.com/media/posts/2/IMG_6709.jpeg\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"1290\" height=\"766\" sizes=\"(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)\" srcset=\"https://djangelic.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_6709-xs.jpeg 320w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_6709-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_6709-md.jpeg 768w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_6709-xl.jpeg 1024w\"></figure><h3 id=\"the-consequence-of-flying-without-a-nest\"><strong>The Consequence of Flying Without a Nest</strong></h3>\n<p>It‚Äôs easy to believe that freedom is found in avoiding commitment altogether. A bird that never builds a nest is free to fly wherever it pleases, to land wherever it finds comfort for the moment. But <strong>without a nest, there is no safety. No stability. No peace.</strong></p><p>A bird without a nest is at the mercy of every storm. It has no shelter when the winds pick up, no warmth when the nights grow cold. It can fly as far as it wants, but it is never truly <em>home</em>.</p><p>When you don‚Äôt build a nest, <strong>you don‚Äôt have to grow</strong>. You don‚Äôt have to work through discomfort, compromise, or build something lasting. You can stay the same, floating from branch to branch, without ever creating a foundation. But that also means that when you fall, <strong>there is nothing beneath you to catch you</strong>.</p><p>A nest isn‚Äôt just a place to return to. <strong>It‚Äôs a place that shapes you.</strong> It‚Äôs a place where love is tested, strengthened, and proven over time. It‚Äôs where you grow‚Äînot in isolation, but alongside the one you‚Äôve chosen to build with.</p><hr>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://djangelic.com/media/posts/2/IMG_6710.jpeg\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"1290\" height=\"1199\" sizes=\"(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)\" srcset=\"https://djangelic.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_6710-xs.jpeg 320w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_6710-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_6710-md.jpeg 768w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_6710-xl.jpeg 1024w\"></figure><h3 id=\"a-well-tended-nest-love-that-endures\"><strong>A Well-Tended Nest: Love That Endures</strong></h3>\n<p>A well-tended nest does not just endure‚Äîit flourishes.

It is not just a physical shelter, but an emotional and spiritual one‚Äî<strong>a home built from trust, consistency, and shared purpose.</strong></p><h4 id=\"how-the-nest-protects\"><strong>How the Nest Protects</strong></h4>\n<p>Life will bring storms. Hardships, losses, and struggles will come, but a strong nest shields those within it. In a well-built nest, partners do not weather the storms alone‚Äîthey hold onto each other, offering comfort and reassurance through the darkest nights. They know that even when the winds rage, <strong>their commitment remains unshaken</strong>, because it was not built on fleeting emotions, but on deep, unwavering care.</p><p>Protection is not just physical safety‚Äîit is <strong>emotional safety</strong>. In a well-built nest, there is no fear of betrayal, no anxiety of being abandoned, no uncertainty about one‚Äôs worth. Each partner knows they are loved‚Äînot for what they provide, not for what they do, but for who they are. <strong>They can rest in the certainty that they are seen, known, and cherished.</strong></p><h4 id=\"how-the-nest-sustains\"><strong>How the Nest Sustains</strong></h4>\n<p>A strong nest allows both partners to <strong>grow individually while knowing they have a steady foundation to return to</strong>. It is where love is replenished, where small acts of kindness reinforce the strength of the commitment.</p><p>It is a place where partners build each other up, where they remind each other of their strength, their dreams, and their worth. It is a place where they can be their truest selves, without masks or pretenses, and still be loved.</p><h4 id=\"how-the-nest-nurtures\"><strong>How the Nest Nurtures</strong></h4>\n<p>A well-tended nest does not just sustain the couple‚Äîit extends to their children and beyond. It teaches the next generation what love looks like. It creates a legacy.</p><p>A nest built with patience and trust is not just a place for today‚Äîit is <strong>a foundation for a lifetime. It‚Äôs the place where two birds grow old together, where their wings become weaker, but their love becomes stronger.</strong> It is a nest that does not just serve them, but serves their young‚Äîoffering them a foundation of love, honesty, and resilience, so they too may one day build a nest of their own.</p><p>And that is why it is worth building.</p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://djangelic.com/media/posts/2/thenest.png\" alt=\"Image description\" width=\"1079\" height=\"610\" sizes=\"(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)\" srcset=\"https://djangelic.com/media/posts/2/responsive/thenest-xs.png 320w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/2/responsive/thenest-sm.png 480w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/2/responsive/thenest-md.png 768w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/2/responsive/thenest-xl.png 1024w\"></figure>",

A heart, the emblem of compassion, linked to the Gut and Brain. Soft lines or a subtle glow tie these elements, signifying the ceaseless flow of emotional and cognitive processes. The backdrop is adorned with a tranquil, soft-colored abstract design, alluding to a harmonized emotional state.</em></p><hr>\n<p>Inspired by the rich explorations from ‚ÄúThe Power of Now‚Äù and thought-provoking podcasts like ‚ÄúPhilosophize This,‚Äù where the ideas of Gilles Deleuze and Byung-Chul Han are discussed, I‚Äôve reached a transformative realization. We humans are not simple, monolithic beings but rather a complex blend of what I term as three primary entities or aspects that together form our multi-dimensional being we call a body:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Your Mind:</strong> Represented by your brain, this is the cognitive powerhouse that serves as your practical navigator through the maze of life.</li>\n<li><strong>Your Emotions:</strong> Located in your gut and intestines, this emotive compass helps you to sense and feel the world around you.</li>\n<li><strong>Your Core Self:</strong> Anchored in your heart, this ‚Äúwatcher‚Äù or soul is that innermost silence you tap into during moments of love or profound joy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By ‚Äúentity,‚Äù I mean a significant part of ourselves that could, at least theoretically, exist independently if given the right conditions. These entities are like musicians capable of solo performances. However, these aren‚Äôt just isolated performers but part of an ensemble. For example scientists are able to keep a heart pumping in a vat alone with nutrients for a while, but for that entity to reach it‚Äôs full potential, it needs to be inside of a body. When I speak of an entity I refer to the organs inside our bodies specifically, with all the chemical processes involved.</p><p>This brings me to the term ‚Äúaspect.‚Äù While each entity has its own set of functions and importance, they are also aspects of a greater holistic being‚Äîus. It‚Äôs when they collaborate to form our being that we realize our fullest potential and the richness of human experience truly unfolds. When I use the the term aspect, I‚Äôm referring to the other plane of existence, eminence. This is closer to our imagination, but it‚Äôs essentially our perception of these entities, or if you‚Äôre religious think of it as where heaven is located.</p><p>I believe that a big part of our suffering as a society stems from the fact that many of us, myself included, will put one of these 3 entities in an elevated position because of distraction, and let it run our body to the detriment of other parts of our body, and we do this unconsciously.</p><p>Contrary to the conventional view of individualism that promotes us as indivisible, single units‚Äîan idea that has led to unnecessary suffering‚ÄîI argue that recognizing and harmonizing these three aspects can unlock better mental health. This isn‚Äôt just a spiritual notion; it has tangible, biological ramifications. When you adopt this nuanced perspective, you‚Äôll likely find your capacity for empathy and love expanding.</p><p>Why? Because even your solo acts are, in essence, a harmonious interplay between these three internal aspects. Mastering this balancing act within you equips you to navigate the external world with a deeper understanding and kindness toward the multi-layered struggles we all inevitably face.</p><p>When most people ponder their own identity, the brain takes center stage. However, this cerebral focus overlooks other vital components that contribute to who we truly are. Elevating the mind alone is akin to lauding the blueprint of an airplane while ignoring the human ingenuity and collaboration required to actually build it.</p><p>I‚Äôve created a visual representation to illuminate this multi-dimensional human experience, using ChatGPT to generate an image described as a ‚ÄúOur Eminence‚Äù This figure encompasses three key elements:</p><ul>\n<li>The Gut: A wellspring of feelings and emotions.</li>\n<li>The Brain: The processor and evaluator of our emotional state.</li>\n<li>The Heart: A symbol of our core self and compassionate nature, which is intricately linked to both the brain and gut.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The heart serves as the emblem of our core self in this visualization. While biologically, many of our emotions emanate from chemicals in the gut, I chose the heart for its dual role. It not only connects the brain and gut but has long stood as a universal symbol of love, which, in my view, is the essence of our humanity.</p><p>By understanding ourselves as a concert of these three aspects rather than a monolithic unit with different entities, we can better navigate the internal struggles for control and achieve a more harmonious state of being.</p><h3 id=\"how-might-this-affect-my-day-to-day-life\">How might this affect my day to day life?</h3>\n<p>To help paint a picture of different ways we can initially lose our balance by focusing on one entity over the other, here are some analogies I find helpful:</p><ul>\n<li><em>Logic Over Personal Needs: Mind over Body</em><ul>\n<li>Imagine you‚Äôre a ship captain plotting a course through stormy seas. You‚Äôre so focused on the navigation charts and long-term goals that you ignore the immediate leaks in your ship. As a result, the ship might reach the destination, but at the cost of immense damage. Similarly, when you solely chase future projections, you risk ignoring the immediate needs of your body, like rest and nourishment, which can lead to long-term harm.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>Loneliness and Physical Relationships: Body over Mind</em><ul>\n<li>Think of your body like a car running low on fuel. In your desperation to refuel, you pull into the first gas station you find, without checking the quality of the fuel or the reputation of the station. Sure, you satisfy the immediate need, but the bad fuel might damage your engine in the long run. Similarly, succumbing to physical urges because of loneliness might offer temporary relief but could have lasting emotional repercussions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>Mindless Eating and Distraction: Mind over Body</em><ul>\n<li>Imagine a juggler juggling balls in the air, but also trying to read a book at the same time. The juggler becomes so engrossed in the book that the balls start to drop. In the same vein, when you divide your attention between eating and something as engaging as social media, you‚Äôre likely to drop the ball on mindful eating, leading to overconsumption.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>Religious Exclusivity: Mind over Body</em><ul>\n<li>Picture a gardener so obsessed with growing one particular flower that they remove all other plants, considering them weeds. While the chosen flower may flourish, the garden as a whole becomes less diverse and resilient. Similarly, being overly religious might narrow your social circle, excluding those who don‚Äôt fit your vision of ‚Äúheaven,‚Äù thereby making your life less rich.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><em>Fitness Over Socialization: Body over Mind</em><ul>\n<li>Picture a virtuoso violinist meticulously honing a complex solo piece, so consumed by the pursuit of perfection that they turn down every invitation to join an orchestra. While the solo may be executed flawlessly, the violinist forgoes the enriching experience of making music as part of a collective. Likewise, an overzealous focus on fitness‚Äîor any individual hobby‚Äîcan estrange you from the social tapestry that both your mind and body instinctively seek.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"benefits-of-religion-and-ritual\">Benefits of Religion and Ritual</h3>\n<p>Here‚Äôs where many religious individuals have an edge: the communal aspect of religious practices and their ritualistic nature, like attending church, offers a built-in social framework that helps nourish both the mind (intellectually, by speaking with others), and the gut (by taking in the smells and sounds and vision of others closely around you). This satisfies the intrinsic human need for social interaction for both your mind and your gut, potentially counterbalancing the isolating effects of other life choices or habits. However, leaning too much into that framework leads to it‚Äôs own problems.</p><p>Consider a person who builds a ship to cross a river. The ship is supposed to be a tool to get from one side to another‚Äîjust as religious beliefs are tools for moral and spiritual guidance. However, imagine if the person becomes so attached to the ship that they carry it on their back everywhere they go, even after crossing the river. Similarly, religious extremism is like refusing to leave the ship behind, becoming so consumed by it that it obstructs the original purpose: to guide you through life, not weigh you down or harm others.</p><h3 id=\"but-my-religion-is-the-truth-why-wouldnt-i-carry-it-around-everywhere-i-may-run-into-another-body-of-water\">But my religion is the ‚Äútruth‚Äù, why wouldn‚Äôt I carry it around everywhere, I may run into another body of water!</h3>\n<p>By focusing on the future body of water, you are no longer living in the present, you are now living in the future, inside your own mind.</p><p>This brings us to an important question: What exactly do we mean by ‚Äútruth‚Äù? Before delving further into the impact of subjective truths, let‚Äôs clarify what we‚Äôre talking about. The term ‚Äòtruth‚Äô is multifaceted, varying based on context. In philosophy, it might refer to correspondence theories that align statements with facts, or coherence theories that fit beliefs into a consistent system. In religion, truth often signifies divine revelation or moral principles.</p><p>However, when we talk about the feeling of ‚Äútruth,‚Äù it‚Äôs a subjective experience. It‚Äôs created by a chemical reaction in our bodies, validating our sense of what‚Äôs ‚Äúright‚Äù or ‚Äúreal.‚Äù There‚Äôs no universal Truth with a capital ‚ÄòT‚Äô that everyone can agree upon. Each of us has a personalized experience of truth, shaped by our own unique biological systems. So, the pursuit of ‚Äútruth‚Äù is more about chasing a feeling than an objective, external reality.</p><h3 id=\"isnt-my-truth-who-i-am\">Isn‚Äôt my truth who I am?</h3>\n<p>Many of these people will argue that they are pursuing truth, or who they are by living in the future or the past, essentially inside their mind. This is a shield that they put up, to give them hope for the future. Given our understanding that truth is a subjective sensation, it becomes clear that one cannot find Objective Truth in religion‚Äîor anywhere else for that matter‚Äîbecause Truth is not Objective but Subjective.</p><p>You can‚Äôt access someone else‚Äôs unique sensation of truth, but you can have your own personalized version informed by your feelings and experiences. Our mistake often lies in seeking a universal ‚ÄúTruth‚Äù in external realms‚Äîbe it religion, politics, addiction, gender, or sexuality. We look outward rather than inward, disregarding the simple fact that everyone‚Äôs sense of truth is inherently unique.</p><p>This search for an external, one-size-fits-all truth is futile because our sensory perception is limited. We‚Äôre not equipped to view reality through all existing spectrums‚Äîjust the ones we can sense, interpret, in a word, feel.</p><p>In essence, there is no singular, overarching Truth that everyone can point to. Instead, truth is a highly personalized chemical reaction, produced and felt within the confines of our biological systems. Acknowledging this allows for a more nuanced understanding of human experiences, steering us away from the vain pursuit of an objective, universal truth, and fostering a more harmonious coexistence among our subjective truths.</p><h3 id=\"what-are-the-consequences-of-confusing-truth-with-identity\">What are the consequences of confusing truth with identity?</h3>\n<p>When you understand yourself as a blend of three distinct aspects‚Äîyour Mind, your Emotions, and your Core Self‚Äîyou gain the ability to hone in on your own personal truths, rather than getting sidetracked by societal labels or the proclaimed ‚Äúuniversal truths‚Äù of others.</p><p>The danger lies in conflating someone else‚Äôs truths with your own identity. This mistake is easy to make, given societal conditioning that pushes us to view ourselves as single, indivisible entities. As a result, we may latch onto a singular truth and define ourselves by it, while ignoring other internal signals such as hunger, loneliness, fear, happiness, love, or presence.</p><p>Because truth is fundamentally a subjective chemical reaction, the dissonance we experience when a deeply-held truth is challenged can be painful. The mind, unable to reconcile this internal conflict, might react by generating emotions like anger or rage as a smokescreen for the underlying pain. Similarly, your body might seek escape through addictive behaviors, ranging from substance abuse to overeating to promiscuity.</p><p>The key to navigating this complex landscape is to resist such distractions and focus on discovering your own subjective truths. When you manage to treat your own internal aspects with kindness, you naturally extend this compassionate understanding to the complexities within others.</p><h3 id=\"what-happens-to-those-that-get-lost-in-their-labels-or-truths\">What happens to those that get lost in their labels or truths?</h3>\n<p>To make it easier to understand, let‚Äôs use a few analogies.</p><ul>\n<li>Imagine your identity as a complex ecosystem, like a forest. In a healthy forest, various elements‚Äîtrees, plants, animals‚Äîall co-exist and contribute to a balanced environment. When one species becomes invasive and takes over, it disrupts the harmony, leading to an unhealthy ecosystem. Similarly, when you allow one part of your identity to dominate such as your religion or politics, it‚Äôs like letting that invasive species overrun your personal ‚Äúforest,‚Äù disrupting your overall sense of self and well-being.</li>\n<li>Let‚Äôs also picture a painter so engrossed in a single color from their palette that they decide to create art using just that one hue. While they may produce something striking, the lack of other colors limits their expression and the richness of their work. Similarly, becoming overly absorbed in a single facet of your identity, like gender or sexuality, can limit the full range of your human experience and expression.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Empathy is key when considering people who find themselves overtaken by these ‚Äúinvasive species‚Äù of identity. It‚Äôs like watching someone navigate a ship they can‚Äôt steer or a painter confined to a single color. Acknowledge the personal toll it might take, such as loss of family or community, and consider that this loss signifies a deeper struggle within their ‚Äúpersonal ecosystem.‚Äù</p><h3 id=\"the-watcher-embracing-your-core-self\">The Watcher: Embracing Your Core Self</h3>\n<p>Shift your perspective from seeing yourself as a singular individual to adopting the role of the ‚ÄòWatcher,‚Äô an observer of your own emotions. By mindfully acknowledging your feelings without passing judgment, you reduce their intensity and allow your core self‚Äîthe Watcher‚Äîto take the helm.</p><p>Your core self inherently embodies a state of love and joy, enabling a level of emotional intelligence and cooperation that surpasses animal instincts.</p><h3 id=\"strengthening-the-watcher-practical-exercises\">Strengthening the Watcher: Practical Exercises</h3>\n<p>Cultivating the Watcher within involves focused practices like meditation and journaling. Sitting quietly or committing your emotions to paper forces you to confront your normally subdued gut feelings, pulling them into the realm of conscious thought.</p><p>Journal about both your pain and your gratitude. This balanced approach not only allows you to acknowledge the origins of your negative emotions but also dilutes their intensity with positive affirmations.</p><p>Daily life often prompts the mind to mask these raw feelings with various defense mechanisms, transmuting them into emotions like anger or jealousy. Over time, this masking process can obscure the root cause of your emotional pain, leaving you tethered to misleading feelings that you falsely identify as your ‚Äòtruth.‚Äô</p><p>By consistently journaling, you break down these emotional barriers, exposing the root causes of your pain and making them manageable. This emotional clarity enables you to engage others with genuine honesty, as you‚Äôre no longer entangled in the superficial layers of deflection your mind creates.</p><p>This heightened level of self-awareness allows you to tackle interpersonal issues at their core, rather than merely addressing surface-level symptoms.</p><h3 id=\"balancing-love-and-boundaries-as-the-watcher\">Balancing Love and Boundaries as the Watcher</h3>\n<p>Being a Watcher centered on love doesn‚Äôt mean becoming a doormat for others. Recognizing your core self as a triad of entities‚Äîmind, heart, and gut‚Äîintensifies your need for self-compassion. When engaging with others, especially in moments of conflict, this perspective keeps you anchored in kindness not just towards them, but first and foremost, towards yourself.</p><p>Let‚Äôs say your spouse says something hurtful. As a singular entity, it‚Äôs tempting to snap back‚Äîafter all, it feels like a one-on-one battle. But when you view both yourself and your spouse as multi-faceted beings, the dynamic shifts. You can more readily perceive the source of their emotional turbulence, whether it‚Äôs driven by the mind‚Äôs ambitions, the heart‚Äôs feelings, or the body‚Äôs instincts.</p><p>For example, if your spouse is fixated on a business venture, their focus might be predominantly on future success, and less on the emotional nuance of the present moment. This tunnel vision could lead them to say things that hurt you.</p><p>Likewise, if your spouse seems emotionally distant or narcissistic, chances are they are seeking external validation‚Äîperhaps through social media, a notorious distraction from real emotional connection.</p><p>The allure of likes and comments on social media can trap people in a cycle of constant validation, reinforcing their individual ‚Äòtruths‚Äô and identities, while simultaneously distancing them from their real-life relationships.</p><h3 id=\"social-media-and-you\">Social Media and you</h3>\n<p>I feel like this video does a good job of explaining why social media is so dangerous.</p><h3 id=\"navigating-pain-in-relationships-a-two-way-street\">Navigating Pain in Relationships: A Two-Way Street</h3>\n<p>Acknowledging your own complexities and those of others allows for a richer, more empathetic interaction. But empathy doesn‚Äôt mean endlessly tolerating harmful behavior. When you approach someone from a place of shared pain and vulnerability, you‚Äôre extending an invitation for honest dialogue.</p><p>If the other person responds with anger rather than vulnerability, that‚Äôs a red flag. They‚Äôre not engaging with you from a position of love but from a need to be ‚Äòright.‚Äô They‚Äôre seeking that burst of ‚ÄòTruth chemical‚Äô that comes when you give in to their anger, a win they‚Äôll likely weaponize in future interactions.</p><p>So, what do you do when faced with persistent harm? Your multi-faceted perspective provides a deeper understanding. You recognize that they‚Äôre not just hurting ‚Äòyou,‚Äô but attacking various aspects of your being. Maybe they‚Äôre feeding off drama to fill their emotional voids, or perhaps their behavior makes it hard for you to focus on self-care.</p><p>The reality is, you can only carry their pain for so long before it affects you detrimentally. If you opt to numb yourself through addictions or distractions, you‚Äôre not really addressing the issue‚Äîyou‚Äôre merely dodging it. The moment you choose to focus on your own well-being, the severity of their inflicted pain becomes too much to bear.</p><p>You now have the clarity and strength to make difficult decisions‚Äînot as a lone entity, but as a council of your internal triad. Because you understand the multiple dimensions of your own pain, you can also see theirs more clearly. While it‚Äôs painful to recognize that you can‚Äôt change their behavior, you can decide how much pain you‚Äôre willing to endure for the sake of a relationship.</p><p>Your empathy expands, but so does your understanding of your own limits. You‚Äôre not just making these hard choices for ‚Äòyou,‚Äô but for the trinity of beings that comprise your true self.</p><h3 id=\"confront-your-pain-the-power-of-presence\">Confront Your Pain: The Power of Presence</h3>\n<p>Embracing the philosophy of ‚ÄúThe Power of Now,‚Äù you learn to dive deep into your pain rather than skirting around it. By sitting quietly and acknowledging this discomfort, you create space for your mind and body to release it. This is what it means to be truly present.</p><p>When you confront your pain and understand its roots, you approach others with a balanced sense of strength and vulnerability. You become a mirror of honesty, deflecting the impulse to project negativity onto others. This newfound focus gifts you a sense of inner tranquility.</p><h3 id=\"the-realm-of-control\">The Realm of Control</h3>\n<p>Sustaining this peace hinges on a simple yet profound truth: Focus on what you can control. The moment you dwell on factors outside this realm, anxiety seeps in‚Äîyour mind‚Äôs alarm system signaling you‚Äôre veering off the path of presence. You start wrestling with phantoms from the past or uncertainties of the future, thereby disturbing the equilibrium of the present moment.</p><p>Before reacting to any situation, pause and evaluate its position in your ‚Äòrealm of control.‚Äô If it lies outside, any reaction isn‚Äôt just futile‚Äîit adds to your pain. However, if it is something you can influence, channel your energies into positive action. Whether that involves leaving a harmful relationship or dispelling toxic thoughts that obstruct your self-relationship, taking control of the now is the key to lasting peace.</p>",

Over the years, I migrated over to password managers, first Lastpass, then 1Password when Lastpass got hacked.<br><br>While all my current clients were successfully migrated over, my old legacy notes still lived in Evernote. They no longer posed much of a threat, as the servers that the passwords belonged to were no longer active. As a digital data hoarder, I still didn't want to lose these data points, but I didn't have a good way to migrate them over.<br><br>Evernote outputs to a proprietary file that Joplin supports thankfully, so for a while I kept them on my Joplin instance, but as someone that is trying to reduce noise, I wanted to get this out of my journal and put it someplace more secure.<br><br>Enter ChatGPT and Powershell. I had chatgpt create a powershell script for me that took all the Markdown Files and converted them over to CSV file that I can then import into 1Password.

Laziness is simply the inability to prioritize important needs over distractions. And in today‚Äôs distraction saturated world, it‚Äôs a never ending battle. No wonder lazy people just want to sit in front of the tv and not have to battle distractions. They can sit and focus on one thing that doesn‚Äôt require input from them.</p><p>You may ask, what distractions are you taking about? The distractions I‚Äôm talking about don‚Äôt take up a lot of mental power, and they aren‚Äôt supposed to. But over time, the sheer amount of micro distractions you have to deal with is immense. Those micro distractions are called advertisements. Almost every site you visit now a days is saturated with ads, not always out of maliciousness but out of a need to keep their websites going.</p><p>Look at social media for example, whether you like it or not, as your scrolling your feed, you see ads appear in front of you, and for a microsecond you have to stop for a second and realize it‚Äôs actually an ad. Then when you realize it‚Äôs an ad you then move forward and make a decision to ignore it. But that moment in time happened. Your brain was temporarily jarred out it‚Äôs main focus which was to scroll through your feed of people you love and trust. And within that feed, those ads which you shouldn‚Äôt always trust, you have to stop what you‚Äôre doing and switch back to focusing on your friends and family. Think of how many ads you see while scrolling through your feed.</p><p>Now think of your phone. How many notifications do you get every day? How many vibrations or dings do you hear in a day. Each one of these are micro distractions.</p><p>That is why computer people are considered smart. It‚Äôs because we know how to remove most distractions (mostly ads) from our life. The smartest of us are able to remove all distractions from their digital experience by using the command line that you see on the matrix. In this environment we are in control.</p><p>And if you‚Äôre someone that has been labeled as lazy, first of all realize that it‚Äôs a label, which is only a snapshot of something in time, it‚Äôs not the actual definition of who you are. It‚Äôs that you‚Äôve been caught in a situation where you put distractions before needs. And that can change, if you make some changes. One of the best is to clean out your social media by unfollowing everyone that does not instantly bring you joy. Every time you see someone on your feed that brings up feeling of jealousy or insecurity, you‚Äôre also being distracted by the present</p><p>If any measure of jealousy creeps up when looking at a person, unfollow them and remove that distraction of insecurity. That will give you more time to focus on only the people that build you up. And then apply this principle to every single tool or social media on your phone.</p><p>I understand that in today‚Äôs age we need to stay connected, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we have to be distracted by other people, we don‚Äôt have time for that. And remember that language is important because we are all living a story. And the story can be that you are either very lazy or very distraction prone. They can both describe the same person, but one of those can be solved by removing distractions and the other is hopeless. What story are you going to tell yourself?</p>",

            "content_html": "<p><strong>Faith, Science, and Raising Open-Minded Children</strong></p><p>As a parent, one of the most profound responsibilities we bear is shaping our children‚Äôs worldview. Recently, I found myself reflecting on the concept of faith and its implications for my kids. Here are my musings on faith, science, and the values I hope to instill in them.</p><p><strong>The Nature of Faith</strong></p><p>To me, faith is akin to an assumption. Like all human constructs, it can be fallible. When we label something as ‚Äútrue,‚Äù we‚Äôre essentially saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have concrete proof, but I choose to believe it.‚Äù This sentiment isn‚Äôt exclusive to religion; it‚Äôs present in science too. However, there‚Äôs a nuanced difference: science embraces the unknown, while religion often attributes it to a divine force.</p><h3 id=\"science\">Science</h3>\n<p>1.¬† <strong>Methodology</strong>: Science uses the scientific method, which is a systematic and logical approach to discovering how things in the universe work. This involves formulating hypotheses, conducting experiments, and analyzing data to draw conclusions.</p><p>2.¬† <strong>Provisional Truths</strong>: In science, theories and laws are always open to falsification. If new evidence comes along that contradicts established thinking, the scientific community will investigate and, if necessary, revise the theories.</p><p>3.¬† <strong>Limits</strong>: Science acknowledges its limitations. There are questions that science currently cannot answer, like why the laws of physics are what they are, or what caused the Big Bang. However, the unknown is seen as a challenge to overcome, not an immutable mystery.</p><p>4.¬† <strong>Transparency</strong>: The scientific process is transparent and aims to be unbiased. Researchers publish their methods and data so that others can replicate their experiments and validate or challenge their conclusions.</p><h3 id=\"religion\">Religion</h3>\n<p>1.¬† <strong>Faith-based</strong>: Most religions are based on faith and have a set of core beliefs that are generally not open to falsification. They offer definitive answers about the unknown, often in the form of divine revelation.</p><p>2.¬† <strong>Immutable Truths</strong>: Religious texts and doctrines often provide answers to life‚Äôs big questions and are considered by believers to be unalterable truths.</p><p>3.¬† <strong>Moral Framework</strong>: Religion often provides a moral or ethical framework for how to deal with the unknown or inexplicable. This can be comforting to people when science does not have the answers.</p><p>4.¬† <strong>Community and Ritual</strong>: Religions often offer community and ritual as ways to confront and cope with the unknown, something that is generally outside the realm of science.</p><h3 id=\"intersection\">Intersection</h3>\n<p>It‚Äôs worth mentioning that there are areas where science and religion intersect. Some religious people embrace what‚Äôs known as ‚Äútheistic evolution,‚Äù accepting the scientific explanation for the origin of species while also believing in a divine creator. Additionally, some scientists are religious and see no contradiction between their faith and their scientific work.</p><p>In summary, science embraces the unknown as something to be studied, tested, and understood, even if that understanding is always provisional. Religion often provides answers to the unknown, offering a framework of immutable truths based on faith. The two can coexist in individuals and societies, but they approach the unknown in fundamentally different ways.</p><p><strong>The Pitfalls of Organized Religion</strong></p><p>I‚Äôve always been wary of organized religion, primarily because it claims to have all the answers. In my experience, this certainty can narrow one‚Äôs perspective, making them less receptive to alternative viewpoints. By placing unwavering trust in religious institutions, we risk succumbing to fanaticism and zealotry.</p><p>While many religious leaders are genuine and well-intentioned, there are those who misuse their influence. Blind faith can make one vulnerable to manipulation, especially when it‚Äôs placed in the wrong hands.</p><p><strong>A World Beyond Black and White</strong></p><p>I‚Äôm concerned about the binary lens through which some religious teachings view the world: a constant battle between good and evil. Such a perspective can instill a perpetual sense of guilt, leading to anxiety and fear. I envision a different worldview for my children: one where life isn‚Äôt a battlefield but a sandbox. Every action has consequences, and it‚Äôs their responsibility to navigate them with integrity.</p><p><strong>Kindness Beyond Scriptures</strong></p><p>I want my kids to practice kindness not because a scripture mandates it, but because it‚Äôs intrinsically the right thing to do. Acts of generosity shouldn‚Äôt be driven by the promise of an afterlife reward; they should stem from genuine compassion.</p><p><strong>Raising Critical Thinkers</strong></p><p>More than anything, I want my children to be critical thinkers. I hope they learn to discern when someone might be taking advantage of them, especially those in positions of power. Through our actions, my partner Tara and I aim to exemplify that true kindness means helping others without expecting anything in return.</p><p><strong>In Conclusion</strong></p><p>As my children grow, I hope they embrace a worldview that values open-mindedness, critical thinking, and genuine kindness. I believe that with these values, they‚Äôll be well-equipped to make a positive impact on the world.</p>",

            "summary": "While we were boarding, a Flight Attendant seated at 14D traveling standby,&hellip;",
            "content_html": "<p>While we were boarding, a Flight Attendant seated at 14D traveling standby, makes his way to the back and asks me for a club soda. As I serve it to him, he looks at my crew members and tells me, ‚ÄúLooks like we have the soul train on board‚Äù which I can only assume is a semi racist remark regarding the fact that my colleagues were black. Since I didn‚Äôt completely understand his reference, I ignored it and he went back to his seat.</p><p>After he takes his seat, he began to wave at me frantically. Worried that there was a major issue I worked my way up through the boarding passengers and inquired what was wrong. Melba proceeds to inform me that his seat back entertainment system was not working and he was unable to watch his movie. I had him reset his system and went back to helping passengers with the boarding process.</p><p>As we got closer to departure he again began frantically waving at me and our number one, Nicole. She worked her way back and asked what was wrong. He informed her that the seat entertainment was still not working. She told him she would manually reset it and worked her way back up to first and reset it.</p><p>As the safety demo begins to play, he gets up and walks to the forward galley and begins to rudely inform the number one that his entertainment center is still not working and also tells her to take his trash. She tells him that she will inform the captain but he needs to take his seat for the safety demo. He goes to his seat, and as I‚Äôm doing a compliance check he rings his call light and motions me over to him. He again informs me that his seat back entertainment is not working and that the number one doesn‚Äôt seem to care.</p><p>I explain to him that we had done all we could do. He loudly and rudely says to me ‚ÄúI guess you just don‚Äôt care do you?‚Äù I asked him what else I could do that we hadn‚Äôt already done? He makes a dismissive gesture with his hands and tells me to ‚Äújust go away.‚Äù I inform the number one and she goes to talk to him. As she was kneeled down speaking to him, he pushed her arm out of the way. She asked him not to touch her and he said ‚Äúwell then get the hell out of my face‚Äù.</p><p>At this point, the whole crew was on edge and no longer felt comfortable with him on the flight. We called the pilot and informed him of his lack of understanding and how he had repeatedly pushed the number one. The captain agreed that he should not continue his flight, and we returned to the gate.</p><p>At the gate, we were met by several managers. The managers asked us if it was ok to remove the unruly flight attendant and if we could do it. We walked to the exit row and the Flight Attendant was on the phone loudly talking to his supervisor. We asked him to please deplane and take his baggage with him. He refused to deplane or get his baggage so I returned to the front of the plane to ask help from the law enforcement officers.</p><p>As the Leo‚Äôs are about to board, he gets up and forcibly pushes one of the managers on his way to the front of the plane. Once off the plane he continues on the phone with his manager ignoring the captain and everyone else. The manager returned to the flight attendants seat to grab his luggage and brings it to the front. The Flight Attendant loudly informs us that he still has bags on board but refuses to describe them. The manager goes back and finds his final two bags which Melba confirms were his. We then close the plane and departed.</p><p>This experience was a stark reminder of the challenges we face as flight attendants. We are trained to handle a wide range of situations, but confrontations like these test our patience and professionalism. It‚Äôs not just about serving drinks or demonstrating safety procedures; it‚Äôs about ensuring the safety and comfort of all passengers, sometimes in the face of unexpected and difficult behavior.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>As I walked to the front of the plane during a flight from San Diego to Dallas-Fort Worth, preparing to conduct a compliance check, an unexpected situation unfolded. Just as I reached the front, a passenger seated in 7B rose to use the restroom. Noticing that my colleague, the #1 flight attendant, was in the midst of service and to avoid any inconvenience, I gently suggested to the passenger to use the lavatory at the back of the plane.</p><p>To my surprise, the passenger became visibly upset. She asserted her frequent first-class flyer status and insisted she had the right to use the front lavatory. She even accused me of discrimination. Remaining calm in the face of her agitation, I explained that my recommendation was purely for safety ‚Äì to prevent her from tripping over the busy flight attendant.</p><p>However, she didn‚Äôt seem convinced and simply walked away, leaving me to reflect on the complexities of managing passenger expectations and maintaining onboard safety. This incident underscored the delicate balance flight attendants must maintain: enforcing rules while accommodating passenger needs, all in the fast-paced, confined environment of an aircraft.</p>",
