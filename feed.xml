                <p>I just wrapped up a quick solo work trip to New York City‚Äîcool weather, a packed schedule, and just enough downtime to explore the city in my own way. </p><hr>

<p>This trip started with a hiccup: what should have been a Wednesday night arrival turned into a bleary-eyed 4 a.m. Thursday check-in, thanks to a <a href="https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2025/08/07/united-airlines-flight-departures-grounded-at-bush-intercontinental-airport-other-airports-nationwide/">United Airlines outage</a>. On the bright side, my Houston leg was in first class, which softened the blow.  </p><hr>

<p>I stayed at the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Aoye44ZBUB98BUKZ6?g_st=ipc">Freehand Hotel</a> in the Flatiron District. The place had character‚Äîmodern design, good location‚Äîbut did try to sneak in an extra fee. Luckily, my company covered it.  </p><hr>

<p>My first morning, I walked to our NYC office, grabbing a breakfast bagel from <strong>Gramercy Bagels</strong> along the way. It was exactly what you want from a New York bagel‚Äîchewy, fresh, and satisfying.  </p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://djangelic.com/media/posts/11/IMG_1502.jpg" alt="Image description" width="1290" height="1685" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://djangelic.com/media/posts/11/responsive/IMG_1502-xs.jpg 320w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/11/responsive/IMG_1502-sm.jpg 480w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/11/responsive/IMG_1502-md.jpg 768w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/11/responsive/IMG_1502-xl.jpg 1024w"></figure><p>Dinner highlights included <strong>East Village Pizza</strong> (classic NYC slice vibes) and <strong>Tenjou</strong> for ramen, which came with a surprise: the noodles and broth were served separately. It took me a moment to figure out the hidden broth compartment, but once I did, it was pure comfort food.  </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://djangelic.com/media/posts/11/IMG_1469.jpg" alt="Image description" width="3024" height="2577" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://djangelic.com/media/posts/11/responsive/IMG_1469-xs.jpg 320w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/11/responsive/IMG_1469-sm.jpg 480w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/11/responsive/IMG_1469-md.jpg 768w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/11/responsive/IMG_1469-xl.jpg 1024w"></figure><hr>

<p>The NYC office is less ‚Äúcubicles and fluorescent lights‚Äù and more ‚Äúincubator coworking space,‚Äù which made it a great spot for filming some content. I spent time chatting with my coworkers, especially Eunice and Zarif, and enjoyed swapping stories over pizza one night.  </p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://djangelic.com/media/posts/11/PXL_20250808_170042959.jpg" alt="Image description" width="2953" height="1691" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://djangelic.com/media/posts/11/responsive/PXL_20250808_170042959-xs.jpg 320w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/11/responsive/PXL_20250808_170042959-sm.jpg 480w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/11/responsive/PXL_20250808_170042959-md.jpg 768w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/11/responsive/PXL_20250808_170042959-xl.jpg 1024w"></figure><p>The main reason for the trip was to present at a customer training session. Initially, my section of the demo was going to be cut, but the client ended up giving us the final hour‚Äîa slot no other vendor (including Google Firebase or Microsoft Power Automate) received.  </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://djangelic.com/media/posts/11/PXL_20250808_163855281.MP.jpg" alt="Image description" width="3062" height="1669" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://djangelic.com/media/posts/11/responsive/PXL_20250808_163855281.MP-xs.jpg 320w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/11/responsive/PXL_20250808_163855281.MP-sm.jpg 480w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/11/responsive/PXL_20250808_163855281.MP-md.jpg 768w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/11/responsive/PXL_20250808_163855281.MP-xl.jpg 1024w"></figure><p>During the session, the client champion invited attendees to stick around for a deeper dive with me. Seven people stayed, and three of them were so engaged that what was supposed to be 30 minutes turned into a full hour. I showed three demos:  </p><ul>
<li><strong>Star Wars workflow</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>Request Router</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>Call Forge</strong> for AI prompt management</li>
</ul>
<p>The LinkedIn request router especially caught their attention, they were already imagining how to repurpose it for email.  </p><hr>

<p>After the demo, I headed back to the office with Liam (a newer teammate who‚Äôs sharp and detail-oriented) to film a benchmarking short. Later, I walked back to the hotel in the cool NYC air‚Äîa small, refreshing moment in a packed trip.  </p><hr>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://djangelic.com/media/posts/11/IMG_1451.jpg" alt="Image description" width="3088" height="2316" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://djangelic.com/media/posts/11/responsive/IMG_1451-xs.jpg 320w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/11/responsive/IMG_1451-sm.jpg 480w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/11/responsive/IMG_1451-md.jpg 768w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/11/responsive/IMG_1451-xl.jpg 1024w"></figure><h2 id="üõç-souvenirs--sights">üõç Souvenirs &amp; Sights</h2>
<p>One highlight was <strong>The Friends Experience</strong>, where I picked up some souvenirs. I also took some time to just sit on a park bench, with two strangers, and watch the city go by. There was something so peaceful about just sitting there, no place to go or be, and just take in the sounds and sights.</p><hr>
<h2 id="üß†-reflections">üß† Reflections</h2>
<p><strong>What I loved:</strong>  </p><ul>
<li>The energy of presenting and seeing people excited about the demos  </li>
<li>Great food (those bagels‚Ä¶)  </li>
<li>Making progress on big work projects even in between events  </li>
<li>Feeling safe and relaxed walking alone at night</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What I didn‚Äôt love:</strong>  </p><ul>
<li>That unnecessary hotel fee attempt</li>
<li>That there weren‚Äôt more n8n employees to interact with.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Overall, the trip was the perfect mix of productive and restorative. I left feeling inspired, connected to my team, and reminded why I love the energy of New York, especially when I can blend work with little slices of everyday city life.  </p>

<p>I arrived late Tuesday and wasn‚Äôt sure what to do with my first evening in the city. I wandered into a small convenience store and picked up a bottle of German wine.</p><p>Before enjoying it back at my place, I stopped at a <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/kWU2ATsgbZZxPpn18?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy">kebab shop</a> for a kebab burger.</p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/IMG_7511.jpeg" alt="Image description" width="4032" height="3024" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7511-xs.jpeg 320w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7511-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7511-md.jpeg 768w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7511-xl.jpeg 1024w"></figure><p>It was decent and filling. Afterward, I had a craving for something sweet, so I visited a <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/7R7qAE3pLeFCKvH7A?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy">local bakery</a> and picked up a chocolate croissant to pair with the wine.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/IMG_7512.jpeg" alt="Image description" width="5712" height="4284" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7512-xs.jpeg 320w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7512-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7512-md.jpeg 768w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7512-xl.jpeg 1024w"></figure><p>The croissant was a little on the stale side, but still tasty.

<h3 id="a-busy-day-in-berlin">A Busy Day in Berlin</h3>
<p>I woke up around 9 AM, feeling surprisingly rested. Breakfast at the hotel was simple but satisfying‚Äîenough to fuel up for the long day ahead. After a quick shower, I got ready and called an Uber to the company hotel, where I dropped off my luggage before heading out for a walk.</p><p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/IMG_7632.jpeg" alt="Image description" width="4032" height="3024" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7632-xs.jpeg 320w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7632-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7632-md.jpeg 768w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7632-xl.jpeg 1024w"></figure><br><em>View from my hotel room</em></p><p>The crisp Berlin air was refreshing, and I took advantage of the morning light to snap some photos during my walk.

I promised to send over some useful resources, including demo videos, performance benchmarks, and details on our webinar series.</p><p>Dinner with the team was a great mix of professional conversation and casual connection. I met several new faces and enjoyed hearing different perspectives from people across the company.</p><p>The night wrapped up with a few drinks in good company before heading back to my room.

<p>The morning kicked off with coffee and informal hellos‚Äîa relaxed way to ease into the day. Then came the first real session: <strong>Turning Points in Company History.</strong> It was eye-opening to see the pivotal moments that shaped the organization. A lot of things I hadn‚Äôt known before suddenly made sense.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/IMG_7823.jpeg" alt="Image description" width="2160" height="3840" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7823-xs.jpeg 320w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7823-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7823-md.jpeg 768w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7823-xl.jpeg 1024w"></figure><p>Next, we did <strong>Personal Lifelines,</strong> an exercise where each of us mapped out the highs and lows of our lives in small groups. It was unexpectedly deep, and there was a touching moment when someone shared big personal news‚Äîeveryone in the group celebrated together.</p><p>The following session focused on <strong>Company Mission, Vision &amp; Strategy.</strong> It gave me a much clearer picture of where we are as an organization and where we‚Äôre heading. Having that kind of orientation was invaluable‚Äîit‚Äôs easy to get lost in the day-to-day, but stepping back like this made the bigger picture come into focus.</p><h2 id="lunch--afternoon-work">Lunch &amp; Afternoon Work</h2>
<p>Lunch was brought in‚Äîsimple boxed salads. I went for the Asian chicken one, which was decent enough.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/IMG_7678.jpeg" alt="Image description" width="4032" height="3024" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7678-xs.jpeg 320w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7678-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7678-md.jpeg 768w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7678-xl.jpeg 1024w"></figure><p>After lunch, we continued our deep dive into company strategy before breaking into <strong>team time</strong> with marketing. It was a productive sync, but I wished we had more than just two hours. There‚Äôs so much we could have aligned on. I also might have stirred up a little tension when I suggested implementing a project management tool‚Äîdefinitely got some mixed reactions.</p><h2 id="go-karting-mayhem">Go-Karting Mayhem</h2>
<p>Then came the highlight of the day: <strong>go-karting.</strong> It was an absolute blast‚Äîpart Formula One, part endurance test. I was loving it until the final stretch, when pure exhaustion set in. At one point, someone bumped me while passing, and I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh‚Äîit was all in good fun and very competitive.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/IMG_7815.jpeg" alt="Image description" width="1290" height="1198" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7815-xs.jpeg 320w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7815-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7815-md.jpeg 768w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7815-xl.jpeg 1024w"></figure><h2 id="evening-celebrations">Evening Celebrations</h2>
<p>After that, we headed to a <strong>street food fair</strong> for dinner. The food was excellent, and the atmosphere was buzzing. The group celebrated a big sales win, and the energy was electric‚Äîeveryone was in high spirits.</p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/IMG_7687.jpeg" alt="Image description" width="4032" height="3024" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7687-xs.jpeg 320w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7687-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7687-md.jpeg 768w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7687-xl.jpeg 1024w"></figure><p>Throughout the evening, I had some great, meaningful conversations with colleagues.

But the night wasn‚Äôt quite over‚ÄîI stayed up talking with a couple of people, learning more about their past experiences and perspectives.</p><p>Finally, at 2 AM, I crashed‚Äîcompletely drained but grateful for a day that felt both intense and deeply rewarding.</p><h1 id="day-4-in-berlin--friday">Day 4 in Berlin ‚Äì Friday</h1>

<p>The final workday of the retreat started with a bit of a struggle‚ÄîI was definitely feeling the effects of the night before.

<p>The morning was filled with a few more sessions, the last push of structured work before wrapping up the retreat. By lunchtime, we split into departments for our final team meal. The marketing group went to an Asian restaurant, where I had udon with duck‚Äîabsolutely delicious.  </p><p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/IMG_7693.jpeg" alt="Image description" width="4032" height="3024" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7693-xs.jpeg 320w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7693-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7693-md.jpeg 768w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7693-xl.jpeg 1024w"></figure>  </p><p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/IMG_7694.jpeg" alt="Image description" width="4030" height="3022" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7694-xs.jpeg 320w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7694-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7694-md.jpeg 768w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/27/responsive/IMG_7694-xl.jpeg 1024w"></figure>  </p><p>Back at Betahaus, we had a few more sessions, then the entire company gathered for a group photo.

                <h3 id="the-nest-trust-and-the-illusion-of-a-cage"><strong>The Nest, Trust, and the Illusion of a Cage</strong></h3>
<p>A nest is built carefully, twig by twig, with patience and intention. It is not merely a shelter‚Äîit is <strong>a home</strong>, a foundation built to protect, sustain, and nurture those within it. The nest is not a cage; it does not confine, but rather, it provides <strong>a place of belonging</strong>. It offers both security and freedom‚Äî<strong>a safe place to return to, a sanctuary that allows growth</strong>.</p><p>Birds leave the nest, but not to abandon it. They leave to gather, to experience the world, to strengthen themselves‚Äîbut always with the knowledge that what they bring back will sustain and reinforce the home they share. A bird might return with food to nourish its partner, or with twigs and soft down to make the nest even stronger. <strong>Each time they venture out, they contribute to what they are building together.</strong></p><p>In a relationship, leaving the nest should mean personal growth, exploration, and independence‚Äîbut never betrayal. True partnership is not about restriction; it is about trust‚Äîthe trust that each partner, when stepping away, does so with the intent to return with something of value. Whether that is <strong>wisdom, experience, support, or simply the reassurance of loyalty</strong>, the time spent outside the nest should enrich it, not weaken it.</p><p>But when one partner starts building <strong>multiple nests</strong>, dividing their energy and effort, something shifts. The twigs that should have reinforced the shared nest are instead placed elsewhere. The resources meant to sustain are spent outside, leaving what was once strong now fragile. <strong>A bird cannot nurture multiple nests with the same devotion. The more it divides itself, the weaker each nest becomes.</strong></p><p>At first, the original nest may hold, sustained by the effort of the one who remains, but eventually, the imbalance becomes clear. The nest that once provided warmth and safety now struggles to remain whole. And if one partner gives too much outside the nest without replenishing what they have built together, the nest does not just weaken‚Äîit begins to fall apart.</p><p>Even worse, bringing <strong>predators</strong> into the nest‚Äîothers who threaten the safety and integrity of what‚Äôs been built‚Äîdestroys it from within. A nest thrives when it is protected, when both partners are selective about what influences they allow inside. When one bird repeatedly brings threats‚Äîwhether through dishonesty, betrayal, or disregard for the shared commitment‚Äîthe nest isn‚Äôt strengthened. <strong>It becomes exposed, vulnerable to being torn apart, either by outside forces or by the first storm life throws at it.</strong></p><p>Radical acceptance teaches us that we cannot control the choices of another bird. We cannot force someone to tend to the nest if they don‚Äôt see its value. What we <em>can</em> do is acknowledge reality as it is, without judgment or resistance. We can accept the pain of watching twigs be plucked away, without letting that pain define our worth or our future. Acceptance is not giving up‚Äîit is choosing to respond to reality with wisdom instead of resistance.</p><hr>

<p>Trust is the glue that holds the nest in place. It is not just about <strong>being faithful</strong>; it is about being <strong>honest, consistent, and dependable</strong>. Trust is what makes the nest feel like home. Without trust, the nest becomes fragile‚Äîno matter how well it was built, it begins to crumble, and eventually, it collapses.</p><p>Every time you tell the truth, every time you are accountable, every time you are kind and loving, <strong>you add a single twig to the nest.</strong> Over time, these twigs reinforce one another, creating something strong, stable, and lasting.</p><p>But every time you lie, betray, keep secrets, or hurt the other bird <strong>you don‚Äôt just remove a twig‚Äîyou risk ripping out an entire section of the nest if it‚Äôs discovered.</strong> The damage isn‚Äôt minor; it‚Äôs catastrophic. A single dishonest moment can undo months, even years, of careful building. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important to think before breaking trust‚Äîbecause rebuilding requires so much more effort than preserving what‚Äôs already there.</p><p>A nest isn‚Äôt just about love‚Äîit‚Äôs about <strong>consistent, thoughtful effort</strong>. Without trust, love alone is not enough to hold it together.</p><p>Radical acceptance reminds us that trust cannot be forced, only earned. We cannot demand that another bird handle the nest with care. What we <em>can</em> do is tend to our own integrity, ensure that our own twigs are placed with honesty and care, and accept when another bird is unwilling to do the same. And if that is the case, we must have the courage to stop waiting for them to return.</p><hr>

<p>Some birds look at the bottom of the nest and mistake its structure for a cage. They focus only on the boundaries‚Äîthe twigs that form the edges‚Äîand feel trapped. They forget that those twigs <strong>aren‚Äôt walls keeping them in; they‚Äôre walls keeping the nest intact</strong>.</p><p>A cage is about control. A nest is about protection.</p><p>A cage is built to confine. A nest is built to nurture.</p><p>A cage forces you to stay. A nest is something you <em>choose</em> to return to.</p><p>The only time a nest becomes a cage is when someone tries to leave but still expects it to be there for them, unchanged, untouched, and waiting‚Äîwhile they build other nests elsewhere. When a bird refuses to participate in maintaining the nest but still wants to return to its warmth, <strong>it no longer sees it as a home; it sees it as an obligation or a resource.</strong></p><p>A true partnership requires <strong>choosing the nest, not just using it when convenient</strong>. It requires recognizing that boundaries <strong>aren‚Äôt restrictions</strong>; they‚Äôre reinforcements. And the moment one partner stops respecting the nest‚Äîwhether by neglect, dishonesty, or bringing outside threats into it, or hurting the other bird‚Äîthe nest is no longer a safe place.</p><p>And when only one bird is fully invested in maintaining the nest, it creates an unfair burden. The bird that is still trying, still tending to the nest, feels abandoned. They are left carrying all the responsibility, waiting for a partner who only returns when it suits them. </p><p>Worse yet, the bird that once worked so hard to maintain the nest may stop, either allowing it to crumble or, in frustration, tearing out sections of the nest themselves. Resentment changes a bird‚Äîit turns effort into exhaustion, love into obligation, and warmth into distance. <strong>It‚Äôs not about one bird being right and the other being wrong‚Äîit‚Äôs about both birds giving equal effort and understanding what the effort means so that the nest remains a place of trust, not resentment.</strong></p><hr>

<p>It‚Äôs easy to believe that freedom is found in avoiding commitment altogether. A bird that never builds a nest is free to fly wherever it pleases, to land wherever it finds comfort for the moment. But <strong>without a nest, there is no safety. No stability. No peace.</strong></p><p>A bird without a nest is at the mercy of every storm. It has no shelter when the winds pick up, no warmth when the nights grow cold. It can fly as far as it wants, but it is never truly <em>home</em>.</p><p>When you don‚Äôt build a nest, <strong>you don‚Äôt have to grow</strong>. You don‚Äôt have to work through discomfort, compromise, or build something lasting. You can stay the same, floating from branch to branch, without ever creating a foundation. But that also means that when you fall, <strong>there is nothing beneath you to catch you</strong>.</p><p>A nest isn‚Äôt just a place to return to. <strong>It‚Äôs a place that shapes you.</strong> It‚Äôs a place where love is tested, strengthened, and proven over time. It‚Äôs where you grow‚Äînot in isolation, but alongside the one you‚Äôve chosen to build with.</p><hr>

<p>A well-tended nest does not just endure‚Äîit flourishes. It becomes a sanctuary, a place of <strong>deep belonging</strong>, where two partners can return again and again, knowing they are safe in each other‚Äôs presence. It is not just a physical shelter, but an emotional and spiritual one‚Äî<strong>a home built from trust, consistency, and shared purpose.</strong></p><h4 id="how-the-nest-protects"><strong>How the Nest Protects</strong></h4>
<p>Life will bring storms. Hardships, losses, and struggles will come, but a strong nest shields those within it. In a well-built nest, partners do not weather the storms alone‚Äîthey hold onto each other, offering comfort and reassurance through the darkest nights. They know that even when the winds rage, <strong>their commitment remains unshaken</strong>, because it was not built on fleeting emotions, but on deep, unwavering care.</p><p>Protection is not just physical safety‚Äîit is <strong>emotional safety</strong>. In a well-built nest, there is no fear of betrayal, no anxiety of being abandoned, no uncertainty about one‚Äôs worth. Each partner knows they are loved‚Äînot for what they provide, not for what they do, but for who they are. <strong>They can rest in the certainty that they are seen, known, and cherished.</strong></p><h4 id="how-the-nest-sustains"><strong>How the Nest Sustains</strong></h4>
<p>A strong nest allows both partners to <strong>grow individually while knowing they have a steady foundation to return to</strong>. It is where love is replenished, where small acts of kindness reinforce the strength of the commitment.</p><p>It is a place where partners build each other up, where they remind each other of their strength, their dreams, and their worth. It is a place where they can be their truest selves, without masks or pretenses, and still be loved.</p><h4 id="how-the-nest-nurtures"><strong>How the Nest Nurtures</strong></h4>
<p>A well-tended nest does not just sustain the couple‚Äîit extends to their children and beyond. It teaches the next generation what love looks like. It creates a legacy.</p><p>A nest built with patience and trust is not just a place for today‚Äîit is <strong>a foundation for a lifetime. It‚Äôs the place where two birds grow old together, where their wings become weaker, but their love becomes stronger.</strong> It is a nest that does not just serve them, but serves their young‚Äîoffering them a foundation of love, honesty, and resilience, so they too may one day build a nest of their own.</p><p>And that is why it is worth building.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://djangelic.com/media/posts/2/thenest.png" alt="Image description" width="1079" height="610" sizes="(min-width: 760px) 660px, calc(93.18vw - 30px)" srcset="https://djangelic.com/media/posts/2/responsive/thenest-xs.png 320w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/2/responsive/thenest-sm.png 480w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/2/responsive/thenest-md.png 768w ,https://djangelic.com/media/posts/2/responsive/thenest-xl.png 1024w"></figure>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>When I first started on my web design journey, I made a lot of bad decisions. Thankfully, the web design world is unforgiving, and taught me early. One of these bad decisions was keeping client data stored in evernote in plain text. Over the years, I migrated over to password managers, first Lastpass, then 1Password when Lastpass got hacked.<br><br>While all my current clients were successfully migrated over, my old legacy notes still lived in Evernote. They no longer posed much of a threat, as the servers that the passwords belonged to were no longer active. As a digital data hoarder, I still didn't want to lose these data points, but I didn't have a good way to migrate them over.<br><br>Evernote outputs to a proprietary file that Joplin supports thankfully, so for a while I kept them on my Joplin instance, but as someone that is trying to reduce noise, I wanted to get this out of my journal and put it someplace more secure.<br><br>Enter ChatGPT and Powershell. I had chatgpt create a powershell script for me that took all the Markdown Files and converted them over to CSV file that I can then import into 1Password. I first created an Archive Vault for these so I also don't see them on the day to day, but can search against them if I need to.<br><br>See below:</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>While we were boarding, a Flight Attendant seated at 14D traveling standby, makes his way to the back and asks me for a club soda. As I serve it to him, he looks at my crew members and tells me, ‚ÄúLooks like we have the soul train on board‚Äù which I can only assume is a semi racist remark regarding the fact that my colleagues were black. Since I didn‚Äôt completely understand his reference, I ignored it and he went back to his seat.</p><p>After he takes his seat, he began to wave at me frantically. Worried that there was a major issue I worked my way up through the boarding passengers and inquired what was wrong. Melba proceeds to inform me that his seat back entertainment system was not working and he was unable to watch his movie. I had him reset his system and went back to helping passengers with the boarding process.</p><p>As we got closer to departure he again began frantically waving at me and our number one, Nicole. She worked her way back and asked what was wrong. He informed her that the seat entertainment was still not working. She told him she would manually reset it and worked her way back up to first and reset it.</p><p>As the safety demo begins to play, he gets up and walks to the forward galley and begins to rudely inform the number one that his entertainment center is still not working and also tells her to take his trash. She tells him that she will inform the captain but he needs to take his seat for the safety demo. He goes to his seat, and as I‚Äôm doing a compliance check he rings his call light and motions me over to him. He again informs me that his seat back entertainment is not working and that the number one doesn‚Äôt seem to care.</p><p>I explain to him that we had done all we could do. He loudly and rudely says to me ‚ÄúI guess you just don‚Äôt care do you?‚Äù I asked him what else I could do that we hadn‚Äôt already done? He makes a dismissive gesture with his hands and tells me to ‚Äújust go away.‚Äù I inform the number one and she goes to talk to him. As she was kneeled down speaking to him, he pushed her arm out of the way. She asked him not to touch her and he said ‚Äúwell then get the hell out of my face‚Äù.</p><p>At this point, the whole crew was on edge and no longer felt comfortable with him on the flight. We called the pilot and informed him of his lack of understanding and how he had repeatedly pushed the number one. The captain agreed that he should not continue his flight, and we returned to the gate.</p><p>At the gate, we were met by several managers. The managers asked us if it was ok to remove the unruly flight attendant and if we could do it. We walked to the exit row and the Flight Attendant was on the phone loudly talking to his supervisor. We asked him to please deplane and take his baggage with him. He refused to deplane or get his baggage so I returned to the front of the plane to ask help from the law enforcement officers.</p><p>As the Leo‚Äôs are about to board, he gets up and forcibly pushes one of the managers on his way to the front of the plane. Once off the plane he continues on the phone with his manager ignoring the captain and everyone else. The manager returned to the flight attendants seat to grab his luggage and brings it to the front. The Flight Attendant loudly informs us that he still has bags on board but refuses to describe them. The manager goes back and finds his final two bags which Melba confirms were his. We then close the plane and departed.</p><p>This experience was a stark reminder of the challenges we face as flight attendants. We are trained to handle a wide range of situations, but confrontations like these test our patience and professionalism. It‚Äôs not just about serving drinks or demonstrating safety procedures; it‚Äôs about ensuring the safety and comfort of all passengers, sometimes in the face of unexpected and difficult behavior.</p>

                <p>As I walked to the front of the plane during a flight from San Diego to Dallas-Fort Worth, preparing to conduct a compliance check, an unexpected situation unfolded. Just as I reached the front, a passenger seated in 7B rose to use the restroom. Noticing that my colleague, the #1 flight attendant, was in the midst of service and to avoid any inconvenience, I gently suggested to the passenger to use the lavatory at the back of the plane.</p><p>To my surprise, the passenger became visibly upset. She asserted her frequent first-class flyer status and insisted she had the right to use the front lavatory. She even accused me of discrimination. Remaining calm in the face of her agitation, I explained that my recommendation was purely for safety ‚Äì to prevent her from tripping over the busy flight attendant.</p><p>However, she didn‚Äôt seem convinced and simply walked away, leaving me to reflect on the complexities of managing passenger expectations and maintaining onboard safety. This incident underscored the delicate balance flight attendants must maintain: enforcing rules while accommodating passenger needs, all in the fast-paced, confined environment of an aircraft.</p>

                <p>Today‚Äôs shift started like any other, with the buzz of a busy airport and the anticipation of a long flight from Baltimore-Washington International (BWI) to Phoenix (PHX). However, an unexpected delay on the runway in Phoenix hinted that this wasn‚Äôt going to be a typical day. Passengers, understandably frustrated, made their displeasure known, creating a challenging atmosphere for us, the cabin crew.</p><p>In the midst of managing passenger concerns and navigating crew scheduling complexities, an urgent call over the intercom transformed the nature of the flight. As I was collecting trash, preparing for our descent, a request for a medical doctor echoed through the cabin, signaling a serious situation unfolding at the back of the plane.</p><p>Rushing to assist, I found a scene of quiet urgency. A passenger, a lady seated towards the rear, was receiving oxygen, her eyes closed, her responses faint. The calm professionalism of my colleague, the second flight attendant (#2), amidst the tension was admirable. He briefed me on the situation: the passenger had complained of nausea and chest pains, prompting him to administer oxygen.</p><p>The situation escalated quickly. Three passengers, identifying themselves as doctors, gathered around the ailing woman, providing immediate care. Their consensus was clear ‚Äì we needed medical personnel ready on the ground. The pilot and our lead flight attendant (#1) were informed, and arrangements were made for Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) to meet us upon landing.</p><p>The landing was tense but smooth. As the aircraft taxied to the gate, the passenger‚Äôs condition worsened, slumping in her seat. The doctors, with practiced efficiency, laid her across the row of seats, preparing her for immediate transfer. Upon arrival, EMTs boarded swiftly, expertly maneuvering the aisle chair to transport the patient.</p><p>As the other passengers deplaned, a mixture of concern and relief was palpable in the air. Our team worked seamlessly, ensuring everyone disembarked safely and efficiently. Once the plane was empty, we headed to our hotel, the day‚Äôs events leaving us with a mix of emotions ‚Äì gratitude for the skillful doctors on board, relief that the passenger received timely care, and a renewed sense of camaraderie and resilience as a crew.</p><p>Reflecting on the day, it was a vivid reminder of the unpredictability of airline travel and the critical role of flight attendants in managing emergencies. Despite the initial challenges and the unexpected medical emergency, our team‚Äôs dedication and quick response ensured the safety and well-being of everyone on board. It was a day that underscored the importance of teamwork, preparedness, and compassion in the skies.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>As a flight attendant, you would think that travel to exotic destinations and international locales would be a given. Sadly, as my latest trip has shown, not all flight attendants travel for fun. I‚Äôm currently on a trip to Lesvos, Greece with a small tour group that caters specifically to flight attendants. So far, it has been an amazing experience getting to know everyone. I feel like flight attendants are consistently some of the coolest people you can meet.</p><p>Each person is different and unique, but our job unites us in a way that makes us all feel like family. Our struggles and lifestyles are similar, creating a camaraderie that anyone in the workplace can understand.</p><p>It‚Äôs interesting how many of our travelers are experiencing their first international trip. As flight attendants, our jobs can be so hectic that traveling for fun can seem pretty daunting. When you‚Äôre told where to fly, where to stay, and when to work, it can create a sense of complacency. Instead of building independence, the job can breed familiarity and routine.</p><p>When we fly for work, every aspect of the trip is handled for us. Our apps tell us where we need to be, who will pick us up, and even give us access to our contracts, which offer protections and limits on what we have to deal with.</p><p>Compare that to traveling on your own, where you‚Äôre in complete control‚Äîand responsible for‚Äîeverything. Want a hotel? You have to book it. Need a flight? That‚Äôs on you. Transportation? Better plan it yourself unless your accommodations provide it. Stuck at the airport because flights are full? No contract is going to get you out of that one.</p><p>That‚Äôs why I believe travel is good for you. It builds confidence. It forces you to solve problems you wouldn‚Äôt normally encounter and pushes you out of your comfort zone. It gives you stories and experiences that no one can take away. It makes you a more interesting and well-rounded person. And when you‚Äôre with friends, it gives you something to talk about.</p><p>Over the years, I‚Äôve been fortunate to visit a long and varied list of places. Every few months, I feel the pull to explore somewhere new‚Äîa different country, a fresh experience, a unique culture. It‚Äôs addictive, especially when your flights cost about as much as a bus ride. My hope is to someday find the perfect place to retire. Until then, I‚Äôll keep chasing that wanderlust and seeing where the next adventure leads.</p>
