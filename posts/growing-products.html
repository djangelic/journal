        <div class="article-content markdown-body"><p>I didn't have a green thumb before this, but it was a cool learning experience. I started by growing with no nutrients and walmart soil, and the results were pretty sad. I slowly upgraded from there. I watched a ton of youtube videos and after 3 grows, I'd say I finally feel like I kinda sorta know the beginning's of what I'm doing lol. Tara likes training the plants to grow sideways so you get multiple mega buds at the top instead of just 1. We got like 6 off one plant this time, it was awesome! And kinda therapuetic, like doing a bonzai. If you haven't grown before, these are the things I can't live without now.</p>

<p>Total Cost: $401.20</p>
<p>I have a bunch of other stuff now, like thermometer, and shit, but I think everything else is extra, this is like the minimum I need to grow. Next I'm going to put a greenhouse on our land with AC to do a much bigger grow, but not just of cannabis, but food too. My ADHD super power is automation (or being lazy as shit lol) so I want to apply that to the greenhouse so we can still travel.</p>
