            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="the-core-idea-three-entities-in-one-body">The Core Idea: Three Entities in One Body</h3>
<p>Listening to "The Power of Now" and "Philosophize This" podcasts made me realize that humans are basically a mix of three entities: the mind, the emotions, and the "watcher" or core self. The idea is to align these three so your emotional and mental states don't run the show.</p>
<h3 id="the-watcher-your-core-being">The Watcher: Your Core Being</h3>
<p>To get control back, you have to become the 'watcher' of your emotions. This involves observing your feelings without judgment. Just being aware and 'watching' your emotions can help dissipate their intensity, letting the watcher take charge. The watcher is essentially your core self, and its default state is a mix of love and joy.</p>
<h3 id="mind-vs-gut-tools-not-leaders">Mind vs. Gut: Tools, not Leaders</h3>
<p>Your mind and gut feelings are not the essence of who you are; they are tools. Your gut is more aligned with your true self than your mind. But if you let your mind or emotions lead, you'll end up in chaos. This is even more true in the age of social media distractions.</p>
<h3 id="the-danger-of-avoiding-pain">The Danger of Avoiding Pain</h3>
<p>Often, we use our minds to create distractions that shield us from confronting our true feelings, especially painful ones. We mask pain with other emotions like anger. This is a form of self-protection, but it also prevents us from facing our actual feelings, like the pain of loneliness.</p>
<h3 id="embrace-the-pain-live-in-the-now">Embrace the Pain: Live in the Now</h3>
<p>"The Power of Now" suggests diving into your pain instead of avoiding it. By being still and observing your pain, you allow your mind to acknowledge it, which in turn allows your body to let it go. This is the essence of 'living in the now.'</p>
<h3 id="the-benefits-clarity-and-control">The Benefits: Clarity and Control</h3>
<p>By diving into the pain, you can then interact with others from a place of calm power. You're honest about your feelings, which avoids projecting your pain and anger onto others. This focus keeps you in control, leading to inner peace.</p>
<h3 id="the-circle-of-control">The Circle of Control</h3>
<p>The key to maintaining this peace is to focus only on what you can control. When you start worrying about things outside your control, anxiety creeps in. So, always consider whether something is within your 'circle of control' before reacting to it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I first started on my web design journey, I made a lot of bad decisions. Thankfully, the web design world is unforgiving, and taught me early. One of these bad decisions was keeping client data stored in evernote in plain text. Over the years, I migrated over to password managers, first Lastpass, then 1Password when Lastpass got hacked.</p>
<p>While all my current clients were successfully migrated over, my old legacy notes still lived in Evernote. They no longer posed much of a threat, as the servers that the passwords belonged to were no longer active. As a digital data hoarder, I still didn't want to lose these data points, but I didn't have a good way to migrate them over.</p>
<p>Evernote outputs to a proprietary file that Joplin supports thankfully, so for a while I kept them on my Joplin instance, but as someone that is trying to reduce noise, I wanted to get this out of my journal and put it someplace more secure.</p>
<p>Enter ChatGPT and Powershell. I had chatgpt create a powershell script for me that took all the Markdown Files and converted them over to CSV file that I can then import into 1Password. I first created an Archive Vault for these so I also don't see them on the day to day, but can search against them if I need to.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>Laziness is not what you think it is. Laziness is not a moral flaw like some people imagine. Laziness is simply the inability to prioritize important needs over distractions. And in today’s distraction saturated world, it’s a never ending battle. No wonder lazy people just want to sit in front of the tv and not have to battle distractions. They can sit and focus on one thing that doesn't require input from them.</p>
<p>You may ask, what distractions are you taking about? The distractions I’m talking about don’t take up a lot of mental power, and they aren’t supposed to. But over time, the sheer amount of micro distractions you have to deal with is immense. Those micro distractions are called advertisements. Almost every site you visit now a days is saturated with ads, not always out of maliciousness but out of a need to keep their websites going.</p>
<p>Look at social media for example, whether you like it or not, as your scrolling your feed, you see ads appear in front of you, and for a microsecond you have to stop for a second and realize it’s actually an ad. Then when you realize it’s an ad you then move forward and make a decision to ignore it. But that moment in time happened. Your brain was temporarily jarred out it’s main focus which was to scroll through your feed of people you love and trust. And within that feed, those ads which you shouldn’t always trust, you have to stop what you’re doing and switch back to focusing on your friends and family. Think of how many ads you see while scrolling through your feed.</p>
<p>Now think of your phone. How many notifications do you get every day? How many vibrations or dings do you hear in a day. Each one of these are micro distractions.</p>
<p>That is why computer people are considered smart. It’s because we know how to remove most distractions (mostly ads) from our life. The smartest of us are able to remove all distractions from their digital experience by using the command line that you see on the matrix. In this environment we are in control.</p>
<p>And if you’re someone that has been labeled as lazy, first of all realize that it’s a label, which is only a snapshot of something in time, it’s not the actual definition of who you are. It’s that you’ve been caught in a situation where you put distractions before needs. And that can change, if you make some changes. One of the best is to clean out your social media by unfollowing everyone that does not instantly bring you joy. Every time you see someone on your feed that brings up feeling of jealousy or insecurity, you’re also being distracted by the present</p>
<p>If any measure of jealousy creeps up when looking at a person, unfollow them and remove that distraction of insecurity. That will give you more time to focus on only the people that build you up. And then apply this principle to every single tool or social media on your phone.</p>
<p>I understand that in today’s age we need to stay connected, but that doesn’t mean we have to be distracted by other people, we don’t have time for that. And remember that language is important because we are all living a story. And the story can be that you are either very lazy or very distraction prone. They can both describe the same person, but one of those can be solved by removing distractions and the other is hopeless. What story are you going to tell yourself?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Faith, Science, and Raising Open-Minded Children</strong></p>
<p>As a parent, one of the most profound responsibilities we bear is shaping our children's worldview. Recently, I found myself reflecting on the concept of faith and its implications for my kids. Here are my musings on faith, science, and the values I hope to instill in them.</p>
<p><strong>The Nature of Faith</strong></p>
<p>To me, faith is akin to an assumption. Like all human constructs, it can be fallible. When we label something as "true," we're essentially saying, "I don't have concrete proof, but I choose to believe it." This sentiment isn't exclusive to religion; it's present in science too. However, there's a nuanced difference: science embraces the unknown, while religion often attributes it to a divine force.</p>
<h3 id="science">Science</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Methodology</strong>: Science uses the scientific method, which is a systematic and logical approach to discovering how things in the universe work. This involves formulating hypotheses, conducting experiments, and analyzing data to draw conclusions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Provisional Truths</strong>: In science, theories and laws are always open to falsification. If new evidence comes along that contradicts established thinking, the scientific community will investigate and, if necessary, revise the theories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Limits</strong>: Science acknowledges its limitations. There are questions that science currently cannot answer, like why the laws of physics are what they are, or what caused the Big Bang. However, the unknown is seen as a challenge to overcome, not an immutable mystery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transparency</strong>: The scientific process is transparent and aims to be unbiased. Researchers publish their methods and data so that others can replicate their experiments and validate or challenge their conclusions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="religion">Religion</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Faith-based</strong>: Most religions are based on faith and have a set of core beliefs that are generally not open to falsification. They offer definitive answers about the unknown, often in the form of divine revelation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Immutable Truths</strong>: Religious texts and doctrines often provide answers to life’s big questions and are considered by believers to be unalterable truths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moral Framework</strong>: Religion often provides a moral or ethical framework for how to deal with the unknown or inexplicable. This can be comforting to people when science does not have the answers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Community and Ritual</strong>: Religions often offer community and ritual as ways to confront and cope with the unknown, something that is generally outside the realm of science.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="intersection">Intersection</h3>
<p>It's worth mentioning that there are areas where science and religion intersect. Some religious people embrace what's known as "theistic evolution," accepting the scientific explanation for the origin of species while also believing in a divine creator. Additionally, some scientists are religious and see no contradiction between their faith and their scientific work.</p>
<p>In summary, science embraces the unknown as something to be studied, tested, and understood, even if that understanding is always provisional. Religion often provides answers to the unknown, offering a framework of immutable truths based on faith. The two can coexist in individuals and societies, but they approach the unknown in fundamentally different ways.</p>
<p><strong>The Pitfalls of Organized Religion</strong></p>
<p>I've always been wary of organized religion, primarily because it claims to have all the answers. In my experience, this certainty can narrow one's perspective, making them less receptive to alternative viewpoints. By placing unwavering trust in religious institutions, we risk succumbing to fanaticism and zealotry.</p>
<p>While many religious leaders are genuine and well-intentioned, there are those who misuse their influence. Blind faith can make one vulnerable to manipulation, especially when it's placed in the wrong hands.</p>
<p><strong>A World Beyond Black and White</strong></p>
<p>I'm concerned about the binary lens through which some religious teachings view the world: a constant battle between good and evil. Such a perspective can instill a perpetual sense of guilt, leading to anxiety and fear. I envision a different worldview for my children: one where life isn't a battlefield but a sandbox. Every action has consequences, and it's their responsibility to navigate them with integrity.</p>
<p><strong>Kindness Beyond Scriptures</strong></p>
<p>I want my kids to practice kindness not because a scripture mandates it, but because it's intrinsically the right thing to do. Acts of generosity shouldn't be driven by the promise of an afterlife reward; they should stem from genuine compassion.</p>
<p><strong>Raising Critical Thinkers</strong></p>
<p>More than anything, I want my children to be critical thinkers. I hope they learn to discern when someone might be taking advantage of them, especially those in positions of power. Through our actions, my partner Tara and I aim to exemplify that true kindness means helping others without expecting anything in return.</p>
<p><strong>In Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>As my children grow, I hope they embrace a worldview that values open-mindedness, critical thinking, and genuine kindness. I believe that with these values, they'll be well-equipped to make a positive impact on the world.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a flight attendant, you would think that travel to exotic destinations and international locales would be a given. Sadly, as our latest trip has shown, not all flight attendants travel for fun. My wife runs a small tour agency that caters to flight attendants called Crew Travelers, and we are currently in the middle of our trip to Lesvos, Greece. So far it has been an amazing experience getting to know all the flight attendants. I feel like flight attendants are consistently the coolest people you can meet.</p>
<p>Each one is different and unique but our job unites us in a way that makes us all feel like family. Our struggles and lifestyles are similar, creating a camaraderie that anyone in the workplace knows.</p>
<p>I find it interesting how most of our travelers are first time international travelers. As flight attendants, our jobs can be so hectic that traveling for fun can seem pretty daunting. When you are told where to fly, and where to stay, it can build a feeling of complacency when you travel. Instead of harboring independence, our job can breed familiarity and complacency.</p>
<p>When we fly as flight attendants, every aspect of our trip is taken care of. Our flight attendant app tells us where we need to be, who will pick us up, and even gives us access to our contract, which gives us a sense of protection when we are working that there limits how much abuse we have to deal with.</p>
<p>Compare that to flying on your own where you are in complete control of your destiny. Want a hotel? You gotta book it. Need a flight? Up to you to book it. Transportation to and from the hotel? That's on you if your hotel doesn't cover it. Stuck at the airport because flights are full? Sorry, no contract will get you out of that.</p>
<p>With all that being said, travel is good for you. It gives you confidence in yourself. It forces you to solve problems that you would normally not face and gets you out of your comfort zone. It gives you stories and experiences that no one can take away from you. It makes you a more varied and interesting human being. When you are with your friends, it gives you something to say.</p>
<p>The list of places that my wife and I have been to is long and varied. Every other month or so we get an itch to see someplace new. A new country, a new experience, a new culture. It's addictive, especially when your flights cost about as much as a bus ride. Our hope is to someday find the perfect place to retire. Until then, we revel in our wanderlust and we can't wait to see what new adventures we stumble upon!</p>

<p><strong>Date</strong>: Thu, 01 Aug 2013 22:05:35 +0000</p>
<p>Wow, what an adventure! So yesterday, I finished the final part of the hiring process with a major airlines to become a flight attendant. It was not an easy process or a quick one, and I hope this blog post helps answer any questions that you might have about the whole process. I became interested in this position thanks to my uncle, who has been a flight attendant for over 27 years with US Airways, and who absolutely loves it! Keep reading for the process I went through to be hired!</p>
<p><img src="https://djangelic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/the_giant_approaches.jpg" alt="test" /></p>
<p>The Video Interview</p>
<p>It all starts with a video interview. This was actually not what I expected. I thought that maybe I would be connecting through Skype or some other program to a live representative and we would be initiating a normal interview that way. It is actually a video recording of you, talking to your webcam (or if<br />
you don't have a webcam, they have a call in option that allows you to record your voice), and asking you questions. These questions are very basic, and two of them that stood out to me where "Why do you want to become a flight attendant" and "Why do you think you would make a good flight attendant." This was easily the scariest part for me, since I was not able to see the person, and you only really get one try per question. I had a lot of Umm's and Ahhh's in there, and was sure I did not pass at all. Thankfully I did, and I attribute a lot of it to SMILING!! I am a happy person in general, and this<br />
helped a lot! I smiled throughout the whole thing. A few days after the video interview, I got an email stating that I had passed the video interview, and I<br />
was ready to move on the next part of the interview, the in person group interview.</p>
<p><img src="https://djangelic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/observatory_tower_lincoln_castle.jpg" alt="One of the main reasons I want to fly, is to visit castles such as this one" /></p>
<p>One of the main reasons I want to fly, is to visit castles such as this one</p>
<h3 id="in-person-group-interview">In Person Group Interview</h3>
<p>This was easily the most fun out of the whole process! They flew me out to Dallas TX to interview with around 30 other applicants. I was given the option to fly out the night before and pay for my own hotel, or fly out the day of. I went the day before, so I would be rested for the interview. When I arrived at<br />
the training area, it was amazing! It is like a giant resort, mostly for their trainees and a few other companies. The trainees live there for two and a half<br />
months during training, and it becomes a home away from home. After checking in the front desk, because I was an hour early, I sat down and noticed a few other people waiting, and started up a conversation with them. They were also applicants, and they were just as excited and nervous as I was. After we entered, the process was pretty straightforward. They had different team building exercises and activities to get to know us a bit better and to see how we interacted with each other. My advice to you here is this. SMILE! Smile<br />
smile smile! Be happy you are there, and excited! Greet everyone you meet! Try to be a leader in the activities if you can, and show the interviewers that<br />
you are confident. At the end of the day, we had our two interviews, a four person panel interview, and a one on one interview. Just remember to be yourself, and again, smile! If you did well, you will be taken separately and fingerprinted in anticipation of the next step, the background check!</p>
<h3><img src="https://djangelic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/james_i_think_your_covers_blown.jpg" alt="Background Check" /></h3>
<p>The Background Check</p>
<p>This part is pretty straight forward. If you passed the group interview, you<br />
will be asked to provide a history of your work background, and more<br />
information. This will take a few days, and if you pass, you will need to go<br />
back to dallas for the next step in the process, The Drug Exam and Agility<br />
Exam.</p>
<h3 id="-2"><img src="https://djangelic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/gettinghugejpg.jpg" alt="getting-huge.jpg" /></h3>
<p>The Drug Exam and Agility Exam</p>
<p>This part should be quite straightforward, you will be required to do a drug<br />
exam, and agility test, although in my case, I was flown out to Dallas to do<br />
this as well. I think the drug exam part is pretty straightforward of course<br />
(make sure to disclose any medication you are taking, and be prepared to have<br />
your doctor send a letter regarding any strong medications you take on a<br />
regular basis), but the agility exam could be difficult if you are a smaller<br />
woman. You will be required to push a certain amount of weight (they don't<br />
tell you exactly how much, but the general consensus is 60 pounds to push,<br />
pull, and lift, all the while maintaining a specific heart rate. Thats pretty<br />
much the final step. If you pass here, you will be invited to the next part,<br />
the Training Process.</p>
<h3 id="the-training-process">The Training Process</h3>
<p>If you have continued to read this, congrats! But here is the tough part. If<br />
you make it through all of this, then you will be invited to go to the Flight<br />
Attendant training. Please keep in mind, you it is two and half months of<br />
unpaid training (room, board, and food will be provided), and from everything<br />
I have read, it is not easy training. Make sure you have enough money in the<br />
bank to cover your bills during that time. I am super excited to start my new<br />
adventure as a flight attendant, and I am looking forward to it! The perks are<br />
awesome, and being able to see the world is an opportunity I don't want to<br />
miss out on. Hope to see you in the air!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Art of Friendship]]></title>
            <guid>43ea02db8fc94cb4886acc8428615029</guid>
            <pubDate>Sun, 18 Nov 2012 16:06:23 GMT</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, over a cup of coffee, a dear friend and I delved deep into the intricacies of friendships. As he expressed his struggles with forging new bonds, I found myself reflecting on the myriad of friendships I've nurtured over the years. While it may seem effortless on the surface, building and maintaining friendships is an art. Let's dive into my musings on the subject.</p>
<p><strong>The Hollywood Illusion of Friendship</strong></p>
<p>Pop culture often romanticizes the idea of a tight-knit group of friends, always in each other's company, sharing every moment. While having a close circle is undeniably special, it's unrealistic to expect constant togetherness. We all lead distinct lives, juggle unique schedules, and harbor varied interests. This diversity is the very essence of a vibrant group. However, the same diversity, if not balanced, can strain relationships. Just as with any bond, overexposure can lead to feelings of suffocation. This is where the concept of friendship circles comes into play.</p>
<p><img src="/_resources/63c9e4e5f15d4ae9a761163e7c1fd302.jpg" /></p>
<p>The above diagram, though not exhaustive, paints a picture of an ideal friendship ecosystem. A core group of best friends, surrounded by a larger circle of good friends, and acquaintances on the periphery. This structure ensures a diverse mix of companions to share life's moments with.</p>
<p><strong>The Essence of Friendship</strong></p>
<p>Friendships aren't about superficial gains or status. They're about sharing experiences, creating memories, and enriching our lives. It's about connecting with others on a profound level, discovering passions, and living life to the fullest.</p>
<p>For those feeling adrift in the sea of social connections, my advice is simple: Step out of your comfort zone. Seek activities that resonate with your soul. Whether it's dancing, hiking, or motorcycling, the world is brimming with opportunities. And while you're out there, remember these golden rules of social interaction:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Embrace Equality</strong>: Avoid the trap of comparing or ranking yourself. Every individual is unique, and no one is superior or inferior. Accept people for who they are, imperfections and all.</li>
<li><strong>Be Genuinely Interested</strong>: Instead of flaunting your achievements, show genuine interest in others. Ask questions, be curious, and let them share their stories. After all, everyone loves a good listener.</li>
<li><strong>Embrace Vulnerability</strong>: Don't shy away from moments of silliness or embarrassment. Let go of the fear of judgment. Dance like no one's watching, laugh at your missteps, and cherish the joy of the moment.</li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, friendships are a journey, not a destination. By being genuine, open, and embracing the world with an open heart, you'll not only forge new bonds but also strengthen existing ones. After all, life is too short for anything less than authentic connections.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Turing Test and the Essence of Humanity]]></title>
            <guid>5bf7b688f1b74ecb890dd4128f023d71</guid>
            <pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2010 07:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I found myself engrossed in a captivating read about artificial intelligence (AI) and the Turing test. This exploration led me down a rabbit hole of introspection about what truly defines us as humans and how our decisions, both big and small, shape the tapestry of our lives.</p>
<p><strong>The Turing Test Explained</strong></p>
<p>For those unfamiliar, the Turing test was conceived by Alan Turing, a pioneer in the world of computer science. The test's premise is simple yet profound: place a human and a computer in separate rooms, and have another human interact with both through text. If the person cannot reliably distinguish between the computer and the human based solely on their responses, the computer is said to have passed the Turing test. In essence, it's a measure of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human.</p>
<p><strong>The Intricacies of Human Decision-Making</strong></p>
<p>What struck me most about this concept is the vast complexity of human decision-making. Our choices are often a web of interconnected events, influenced by a myriad of factors. While machines make decisions based on logic and data, humans often incorporate emotions, past experiences, and even societal pressures into their choices.</p>
<p>Take smoking as an example. From a purely logical standpoint, given the well-documented health risks, one would assume the decision to avoid smoking is straightforward. Yet, millions continue to smoke. Why? Because human decisions often factor in intangibles like peer pressure, societal perceptions, and emotional states. A computer, when presented with the same data, would likely conclude that smoking is detrimental and should be avoided. But humans, with our intricate web of emotions and experiences, might arrive at a different conclusion.</p>
<p><strong>Emotion: The Quintessential Human Trait</strong></p>
<p>This brings me to a pivotal realization: the essence of humanity might very well lie in our capacity for emotion. Robots, no matter how advanced, don't feel joy, sorrow, love, or fear. They don't make choices based on a gut feeling, a past heartbreak, or a fleeting whim. Humans, on the other hand, are often guided by these very emotions, even when they defy logic.</p>
<p>Our brains, unlike computers, aren't just organic processors. They're repositories of memories, emotions, and abstract thoughts. We associate decisions with past experiences, future aspirations, and a plethora of emotions. This depth of feeling, which can't be quantified or programmed, is perhaps what truly separates us from machines.</p>
<p><strong>In Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>While AI and machines continue to advance, achieving feats once thought impossible, there remains an intangible essence to humanity that can't be replicated. It's our ability to feel, to empathize, and to make decisions that can't always be explained by logic. In my humble opinion, it's this rich tapestry of emotions and experiences that makes us uniquely human.</p>
