            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It looks like mold got to the Liberty haze seeds. I think I put too much water in the seedling tray which over saturated the seeds and led to mold growth. RIP.</p>
<p>Lesson learned, now on to white widow, which are our last seeds so we will need to order some more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first seed is doing great and I can see it start to sprout in the worm castings:</p>
<p><img src="/_resources/0dcf45a7363e4528baea5a48fc4cf104.JPG" /></p>
<p>I'm not so sure about the second one unfortunately. I may have waited too long before moving it into the growing medium? I see something that kinda looks like a cap of the seed, but not sure. Will give it time, maybe I didn't bury it deep enough?</p>

<p>Amnesia however is doing great!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Because of my negligence, 2 of the 3 seedlings died in the seedling trays. An expensive lesson learned ($20). An additional lesson learned is to be careful when adding seeds to water. Make sure you put the water in first, not vice versa. Thankfully, the two new seeds are ok and floating in water currently. They will be put into paper towels soon! The two new seeds are Liberty Haze.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I realized I had a piece of wood laying around that was the perfect width for the shelf slot on my Costco shed. I cut it to the right length, and bam I have a gardening shelf in my bike shed!</p>
<p><img src="/_resources/fb4d859d738b47aebe4871839638a9cb.jpg" /></p>
<p>I took the old dirt and cleaned out the old plants from it.<br />
<img src="/_resources/1abe755e84794c298432ac5593ce690c.jpg" /></p>
<p>I then mixed in a half trowel of earthworm castings as fertilizer to recharge the soil. I’ll be using nutrients too so I think we will be fine recycling the dirt.<br />

<p>We then planted our little seedlings!<br />

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ChatGPT is saying that they should be ready for harvest between <strong>November 10, 2023, and December 1, 2023</strong>. We put them in water on August 25th.</p>
<p>Excited to see how they look! Going to start a grow journal for this plant and hopefully do a better job of tracking it.</p>
<p>We still need to order more rocket fuel.</p>
<p>We need to figure out a better automated water situation? Specifically the lid of the existing bag keeps coming off which could contaminate the water. I should 3d print something that allows air to go through but not bugs and dust.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I didn't have a green thumb before this, but it was a cool learning experience. I started by growing with no nutrients and walmart soil, and the results were pretty sad. I slowly upgraded from there. I watched a ton of youtube videos and after 3 grows, I'd say I finally feel like I kinda sorta know the beginning's of what I'm doing lol. Tara likes training the plants to grow sideways so you get multiple mega buds at the top instead of just 1. We got like 6 off one plant this time, it was awesome! And kinda therapuetic, like doing a bonzai. If you haven't grown before, these are the things I can't live without now.</p>

<p>Total Cost: $401.20</p>
<p>I have a bunch of other stuff now, like thermometer, and shit, but I think everything else is extra, this is like the minimum I need to grow. Next I'm going to put a greenhouse on our land with AC to do a much bigger grow, but not just of cannabis, but food too. My ADHD super power is automation (or being lazy as shit lol) so I want to apply that to the greenhouse so we can still travel.</p>
